# About
A collision between Google's "Material Design" and the current climate surrounding "design minimalism" in blog platform themes.

# Quick Start Install

Make sure you've installed Node.js - We recommend the latest **Node v0.10.x** release.

Ghost is also compatible with **Node v0.12** and **io.js v1.2**, but please note that these versions are more likely to run into installation problems. May contain nuts. Please use the [forum](https://ghost.org/forum/installation/) for help.

1. Download the [latest release](https://ghost.org/download/) of Ghost
1. Unzip in the location you want to install
1. Fire up a terminal
1. `npm install --production`
1. Start Ghost!
    - Local environment: `npm start`
    - On a server: `npm start --production`
