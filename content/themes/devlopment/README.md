# Readymade Lite Documentation

## Inverted Header Text
If you're willing to peak under the hood of this theme, you can quickly and easily add a class of "inverted" to the `<header>` element in `default.hbs`. Doing so will turn the text blog title from black on white, to white with transparecny. Experiment with this option if you find that the default style clashes with your chosen "blog cover" image.

## Disqus Commenting
Readymade Lite supports Disqus commenting on the post and static page templates. To enable Disqus, simply locate the disabled code at the bottom of "post.hbs" or "page.hbs" and remove the html comments (`<!--` and `-->`).

## Sidebar custom links
You can easily add custom links to the Readymade Lite sidebar. To do so, open up `/partials/sidebar-links.hbs`. Contained in that file are detailed instructions and an example link to get you started.

## Social media links
You can easily add social links to the Readymade sidebar. To do so, open up `/partials/social-links.hbs`. Contained in that file are detailed instructions and example links to you started.
