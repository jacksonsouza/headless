I was dealing with [these](http://www.minnetonkamoccasin.com/Products/Detail/classic-moc) moccasins with a typical \"sewn-in\" sole as opposed to one that is glued on. I am unsure about dealing with glued on soles and what the process for those would be. The entire reason behind this project is that my soles had worn down over 6 months, enough to break the thread which unraveled the entire sole from the bottom of the shoe.\n####Examine old soles & determine replacements\nConsider thickness, and tread. I suggest you go with a sheet of vibram rubber, because you can cut the new soles in a perfect outline of the old. Ready-made soles may not match. I used a sheet of 6mm Vibram \"Cherry\" from [DIY Footwear](http://www.diyfootwear.com/vibram-cherry-6mm/).\n####Make shoe clamps\nTwo small pieces of plywood on either side of one clamp. You will need either two or four of these rigs. Two if you want to clamp the shoes together and you dont have more than two clamps, like me. Four if you are thorough and neat. \n> This and the car method of pressure will do a number on the leather if it seems fragile. You have been warned.\n    \n-----\n### Day 2: Resoling\n___________\n####Cut out replacement soles\nTrace your old soles onto the sheet of rubber. Take care so that you do not end up with two right soles like me!\n<br>\nLuckily for you, my mistake shows the ability of these methods of resoling to last, even with the bumpy, treaded side connected to the leather. Obviously, you want the flat, non-treaded side connected with the moccasin.\n####Clean moccasin bottoms\nRemove all debris. The first step to success is making the bottoms surgically clean. I used a combination of GooGone, a razor blade, a wire brush and sandpaper to make this happen. After this, if the bottoms are not already suede, brush them into suede with the wire brush. Give the bottoms a final, hard cleaning with wire brush repeatedly dipped in acetone. Use it very librally, you want the soles to be a bit damp when you glue them. The reason for acetone is that the new Barge Cement formula now lacks a certain ingredient & the acetone works to counteract this lack, making the bond stronger all while making the soles cleaner. Something about ketones.\n\n>####While wet with solvent and with good ventilation:\n\n\n####Apply cement to moc bottom and new sole, spread carefully and evenly with brush\nEmphasis on carefully, the glue dries a translucent yellowy white. If you get it all over the sides of your moccassins, they will literally look like you smeared boogers all over them.\n\n####Wait 5 minutes & apply second coat on both\n<br>\n\n####Wait 5 minutes & apply third liberal coat to only moc bottoms on the heels and toes\n<br>\n\n####Wait 20 minutes for tackiness & align soles with bottoms and stick together.\nPlease be advised you will only be able to do this once, there is little to no readjusting after you have touched them together.\n\n####Put towel over each shoe & beat with hammer/mallet (Bottom and top)\nSpecial attention to heels and toes. This will help solidify the bond so the soles do not move whatsoever during the pressure applied over the next day. One of the links in the sources section says to \"beat the hell out of them.\" Don't hold back!\n\n####Lay towels over the shoes and place under back tires of your car.\nAlternatively, you can make a shoemaker’s anvil or jury rig a clamping structure that allows for heavy, even distribution of pressure. I chose the car.\n<br>\nBack over the shoes so that they are covered (most importantly in the heel and middle). Please use towels to cover the shoes, and leave for 12 hrs. Remember, you are looking for heavy, even pressure.\n\n\n____\n###Day 3: Final Touches\n_______\nTake out from under car, clamp heels and toes of the shoes separately between your makeshift clamping rigs for another 12 hrs. After that, they are free to be worn.\n<br>\n\nReformation will take place over the next couple days of wear, seal any gaps that may form during this period between moc and sole with Shoe Goo. Gaps will usually form from inaccurate sole cuts or gluing, where the sole is bent up the side of the moc during wear. If you aligned the soles perfectly and applied an adiquiate amount of glue and pressure, then you should not have to do this. If you have a belt sander or Dremel handy, then use this to smooth out the edges of the soles and any innacuracies in placement.\n<br>\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n","html":"<blockquote>\n  <p>For increased durability &amp; ground feel, and\n  as a replacement for the shitty standard Minnetonka soles.

The idea was essentially spurred by the video below.\n\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/85040589\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/85040589\">THE GAP by Ira Glass</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/frohlocke\">frohlocke</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\n____\n\nGlass says, \"Your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you... Alot of people never get past that phase, alot of people at that point they quit.\" He goes on to say that in order to bridge that gap, between your taste and production, you must struggle through \"a large volume of work\".\n\nI applaud him for making this insight, but what can be said of this gap and the struggle? What keeps people from quitting? Glass has made us aware of the gap, but how does one overcome it?\n\nThere is truth in him saying, \"by moving through a large volume of work\". At a certain point, rote repitition is the only way to move past certain artistic blocks. For instance, when a person learning the guitar cannot switch chords fast enough; repition works especially well for physical limitation. This is well represented in sports, but the question remains: what if you have no coach. How does one sucessfully engage in independant practice without a stable source of knowledge? Repitition of disappointing work with little growth is literally the fast-track to becoming a sub-par artist. So when Ira asks us to produce a large volume of work, I say what work? How does one keep from perpetually disappointing themselves? \n\nGlass gives us awareness of the gap, and we have established that \"practice makes perfect\", but before anything, one must be able to choose the right work. This barrier to knowing the what and how and why of a subject is commonly referred to as a learning curve and is what Diarist seeks to remedy.\n\n####Awareness of the gap is only the very first step to overcoming it.\n\nBy blending small, diary style posting with a guide-esqe, expository assembly of the individual posts by the Diarist app, I hope to create courage in the face of this gap. \n\nI imaging the user's hands trembling, half in fear and half in excitement when they enter their \"diary\" name. A question, not impossible, but one that seems insurmountable. Users with no programming experience could enter \"I want to publish an iOS App\" or people with questionable writing could say, \"How to write a novel\" and they could trust in the Diarist community and the app itself to guide them.\n\nThe wealth of information created by the community of Diarists could take care of the specifics pertaining to each subject, but the application itself could provide a framework, incentive and a set of general beginning materials. Suggestions for sub-goals or \"chapters\" could be auto-suggested by the app, pulling from other diarys.\n\nHowever the only way to test this method of overcoming learning curves and to hone it is to take part in it myself. I will keep a daily journal on the development of this app beginning with the question: How do I create & publish a web application? With my first \"chapter\" as: App Flow & Prelimiary Research and second as: Web App Architecture & MEAN. \n\n____\n\n6/13 Friday - Preliminary Research\nThe Importance of Habit\n\t<br>Insight:\n    <br>When one does something alot within the confines of a habit loop, they learn to like it, they gain pleasure from it. They gain pleasure from the fufillment of the craving.\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg\n    \t<br>\n        \n6/14 Saturday - Preliminary Research\nDefinitions of Learning Curves\n\t<br>Insight:\n    <br>Learning curves are often exponential followed by a plateau. Habit and persistance are the driving forces behind the growth, the plateau afterword must be addressed but can be ignored for now, since we are focusing primarily on the struggle that comes with the initial curve. The struggle behind this \"steep\" curve can be identified as having to do with both the seeming insurmountablilty of the goal <b> and </b> the blistering, pummelling pace at which the initial learning comes. Refer to the x,y graph on the wiki resource.\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve\n    \t<br>\n___\n6/15 Sunday - Preliminary Research\nKeystone Habits\n\t<br>Insight:\n    <br>Duhigg refers to habits that lead to change in other aspects of life, or as catalysts for more positive actions: Keystone habits. He writes that these pillars of the habit world cause \"small wins\" and \"allow other habits to flourish by [architecting] new structures.\" As this pertains to Diarist, we want this once-a-day journaling to be the keystone habit for the goal or process or skill that the user wants to attain. It would not directly cause it but rather follow like this: A man wants to be a blues guitarist, so the writing would help him (this is the part that the keystone habit causes ->>) anaylze his progress and push him to continue, both emotionally & subject-wise. As for when to record, when to write, the interface needs to be as easy to open as TextEdit. I often record when I feel a \"spark\", or an interesting instance where the resource connects with my subject (particularly a preexisting question). I write when I can quite literreally feel the connections form in my brain, these \"coherent & exciting moments of mental and physical inspiration\"\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg\n    \t<br>\n    \n____\n    \n    \n6/16 Monday - Preliminary Research\nOn Habits & Specific Rules\n\nB.J. Fogg on Habits\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8\n\nThis talk was really great, it offered new views on habit other than Duhigg's  loops which I sorely need. It also points out many of the traditional problems with methods of changing habits.\n\nHe begins with a description of a small change and reward. To me, a rediculously small change and a silly reward. I do not know whether or not this common troupe in the global habit change discussion is purely used to illustrate a point or whether a man that teaches at Stanford really believes that minute increments and pats on the back are really the way to go.\n\nHe claims, like Duhigg, that using motivation and sheer willpower as \"cues\" and \"rewards\" is a losing strategy. I do not entirely disagree, but both of these things are nessicary for the long haul, as motivators of change. Maybe Fogg can transition from the rediculousness of doing pushups after he uses the toilet. Habits may be somewhat systematic and need to be made automatic, but they are also organic and require a certain grace to execute. I cannot justify a routine if the cue and reward are meaningless.\n\nWhen Fogg begins to talk about Weight Loss and the myriad of associated habits or behaviors that must be changed in order to lose weight, he touches on Diarist \"chapters\". Small wins must fall between the chapters as they act as big wins. Weight Loss is the question we want you to ask, and the chapters are the many steps to get there. He mentions stress reduction, diet and excerise to name a few.\n\nBaby steps with grace & meaning limit the amount of backsliding that may happen. You come to Diarist with the motivation, and we help you overcome the gap in ability. Not specifically, but by setting up a structure that allows you to do it yourself and will limit chance for failure, burnout & all other associated pitfalls. The structure most importantly supports and increases motivation. Although, rewards may be backsliding. 6 days and a cheat day.\n\nThis is what a cue is comprised of, and Fogg hits this right on the head: adiquite motivation, ability & a trigger. More of the specifics of his model can be found at: http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html\n\nIn the case of \"tiny habits\" as Fogg presents them, he says much like Duhigg: using existing cues and replacing the routine works. Fogg suggests replacing the already small routine with a yet smaller one, increasing the likeliness that we will do it according to his motivation vs. skill chart.\n\nBack to Duhigg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voX0gUn_JOI\n\nHe shines a light on the extrinsic means for the internal reward. At first, he says, cues and rewards must be external enough to trick the brain. Eventually they may fade into internal feelings in liu of the external reward which once provided those feelings.\n\nHe also goes into depth about the mechanics of habits of the individual and how groups support them emotionally. He says that intellectually we may be able to tell that we can change, but groups are important in moments of weakness.\n\nAT 22:00 he talks about food journaling and how the process and repitition of documenting a process can lead you to avoidence of mistakes and progress. They learn their own patterns. Avoiding stupidity rather than being brilliant - Charlie Munger. He points out that willpower is easily taxed. Willpower is not used when actions are habitualized.\n\n____\n6/17 Tuesday - Preliminary Research\nMotivation & Habits Specifics\n\nhttp://blog.greatcodeclub.com/learn-new-things/\nA great blog & resource to help developers take on side projects. A few great quotes here: \n>\"However, my goal was never to learn how programming languages work. My goal was to create one, so I had to learn. I think this is very important. Learning for the sake of learning never worked for me, but learning because I wanted to do something with that knowledge did.\"\n\nThis post comes close to the proposed Diarist way of small wins journaling. The rules at the end are indespensable too. Yesterday, I remember an important thing that I forgot to write down. A habit for around a month usually cements it.\n\nTwo rules what have helped me are: ones from Leo Babatua \"Make it a rule never to skip two days in a row.\" and one from freshman English 101, \"always allows yourself to spew a 'shitty first draft'\", editing on-the-go restricts the flow of ideas. These really have to do with both the app itself (what it gives to the user) and the flow (the meta, what the app is trying to achieve)\n\nBabauta's list on his blog Zen Habits is a great summary of all the things I have discussed or in some capacity learned so far. http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-4/\nI felt good knowing that I could still learn from each of the points without seeing them as something completely new. It seems that what is coming soon is application of these points about habits and its processes into an app flow. Then, before learning MEAN & web app architechture I need to validate my idea with actual users.\n\nA great place to look for further info would be Tim Ferriss & his books. As inspired by his \"Day In the Life Of...\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV2hLYqRnvY.\n\n6/18 Wednesday - Preliminary Research\nClean-Up, Learning Curves & RAS\n\nDid a little resource hunting today and transferring of ideas from numerous text edit files to this blog.\n\nKaufmen debunks the 10,000 hour rule. Found this to be encouraging. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY\nAt 8:00 he talks about learning curves. Gives a great graph. Reinforces what I have learned so far, which is great because I know that I am on the right track.\n\nHe says it takes 20 hours to break the curve, via <b> rapid skill aquisition </b>. More definitley needs to be looked at on this topic. Tim Ferriss would be great. MAGICAL words after 10:00.\n\n____\n\n6/19 Thursday - Preliminary Research\n\nBegan Start Small, Stay Small by Walling. He avoids the venture-capital buisness-y startup lingo and communicates from a developers POV which is good. He stresses niche market, which I have read time and time again. I will need to target Diarist at a specific group. This can happen with the subjects. If we start the community with say, health and fitness/barefoot runners (super specific) and electronic music producers? Were going out \"two or three descriptors\" black barefoot runners, dubstep edm producers, ect... \n\nAfter reading, I should probably fill in this sentance: \"A skill & habit mastery tool for ______\". I think it would be neat to either advertise or begin with 2 subjects like this: \"A rapid skill aquisition tool for weightliters and web developers\" or for \"barefoot runners and banjo players\". I think <b>rapid skill aquisition tool without any spoonfeeding or hard framework </b> is really at the heart of Diarist. \n\nWe can really feed off of anti-self help, that is spoonfeed-y, non-universal, rigid and cheesy material, in favor of \"increased learning, your way\" in a kind of guarenteed results vibe. Guarenteed results if you do your subject & write every day, or according to the schedule that you post (eminating keystone habit). This would be the only rigid part to the system. Helping with the RSA process via education & a framework involving habit, RSA, willpower, ect (all of the latest research) <b>and</b> their chosen subject. The latter will mainly lie in encourangement, connection with the community & suggestions from Diarist.\n\nI wonder: RAS pointed at amateurs with motivation, without telling them that they are amateurs. We dont want to target people who already have these skills. Remember, when they come to Diarist, they need to supply the motivation. The resevour of \"i want to change\", not laziness.\n\n____\n\n6/20 Friday - Preliminary Research, App Flow\nConsolidating Ideas from TextEdit Notes\n\nAs well as this primarily being a RAS tool, the what differentiates it from other systems is its dependance on the keystone habit: diary writing. For the community at large, the individual journies (diarys) bring a sense of unity, through the personal writing, to particularly difficult projects. As this pertains to guides and instructions on the internt: typically one must undergo struggle and then upon realization of their initial question or goal, they must synthesize a guide out of completion, often losing the personal journey & minute details that come during the journey to the answer. It is not the answer but the journey that counts, the journey is what makes the end unique. \n\nA user might first approach Diarist like this: I want to delve into the subject or learn this skill,\nbut it has a large learning curve & I don’t know where to begin (what resources to look at, who to ask, what tools to use…) Again Diarist seems to be a great idea for multifaceted projects (those that seem overpowering and insurmountable) where multiple subjects/trade secrets/ect are involved, and not so great for surface level, specific questions (i.e. how do I release an album, how do I produce electronic music).\n\nOn app flow: Posts include thoughts/setbacks/progress in the form of prose, video or pictures. This is day based, timeline based. Through this method of posting “small wins”, the emphasis is on a personal chronicle of struggle and success. The posting interface and service as a whole ties them together & spurs additional progress. “What I used, how I used it, what was the end product of me using it (ie. what did i learn, how did I feel about using it, how did this progress me towards my greater goal)” essentially self reflection intertwined with expository writing. \n\nAlso, to spur progress Diarist could have awards: \"Forger Award - first to complete a diary about this\" Emails could look like: Here is what other people have said about this:\n- on diarist<br>\n- on specific internet resources<br>\n- on google<br>\n- in non-internet resources<br><br>\nthese resources lead somewhere.\nAfter diary begins, video masterclass on progress\n\n___\n\n6/21 & 6/22 Saturday, Sunday - Tidying Up & Expanding Posts (Streamlining & Wrap Up Idea Synthesis)\n\nLeaving posts raw. Is this important? Probably.\n\nFor the future:\nMEAN Stack & Database Learning:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20605824/mean-stack-course-tutorial-node-js\n\nhttp://teamtreehouse.com/library/database-foundations\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Diarist is a web app that deals with learning curves.

At a certain point, rote repitition is the only way to move past certain artistic blocks. For instance, when a person learning the guitar cannot switch chords fast enough; repition works especially well for physical limitation. This is well represented in sports, but the question remains: what if you have no coach. How does one sucessfully engage in independant practice without a stable source of knowledge? Repitition of disappointing work with little growth is literally the fast-track to becoming a sub-par artist. So when Ira asks us to produce a large volume of work, I say what work? How does one keep from perpetually disappointing themselves? </p>\n\n<p>Glass gives us awareness of the gap, and we have established that \"practice makes perfect\", but before anything, one must be able to choose the right work. This barrier to knowing the what and how and why of a subject is commonly referred to as a learning curve and is what Diarist seeks to remedy.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"awarenessofthegapisonlytheveryfirststeptoovercomingit\">Awareness of the gap is only the very first step to overcoming it.</h4>\n\n<p>By blending small, diary style posting with a guide-esqe, expository assembly of the individual posts by the Diarist app, I hope to create courage in the face of this gap. </p>\n\n<p>I imaging the user's hands trembling, half in fear and half in excitement when they enter their \"diary\" name. A question, not impossible, but one that seems insurmountable. Users with no programming experience could enter \"I want to publish an iOS App\" or people with questionable writing could say, \"How to write a novel\" and they could trust in the Diarist community and the app itself to guide them.</p>\n\n<p>The wealth of information created by the community of Diarists could take care of the specifics pertaining to each subject, but the application itself could provide a framework, incentive and a set of general beginning materials. Suggestions for sub-goals or \"chapters\" could be auto-suggested by the app, pulling from other diarys.</p>\n\n<p>However the only way to test this method of overcoming learning curves and to hone it is to take part in it myself. I will keep a daily journal on the development of this app beginning with the question: How do I create &amp; publish a web application? With my first \"chapter\" as: App Flow &amp; Prelimiary Research and second as: Web App Architecture &amp; MEAN. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/13 Friday - Preliminary Research <br />\nThe Importance of Habit <br />\n    <br>Insight:\n    <br>When one does something alot within the confines of a habit loop, they learn to like it, they gain pleasure from it.

Habit and persistance are the driving forces behind the growth, the plateau afterword must be addressed but can be ignored for now, since we are focusing primarily on the struggle that comes with the initial curve. The struggle behind this \"steep\" curve can be identified as having to do with both the seeming insurmountablilty of the goal <b> and </b> the blistering, pummelling pace at which the initial learning comes. Refer to the x,y graph on the wiki resource.\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve</a>\n        <br></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/15 Sunday - Preliminary Research <br />\nKeystone Habits <br />\n    <br>Insight:\n    <br>Duhigg refers to habits that lead to change in other aspects of life, or as catalysts for more positive actions: Keystone habits. He writes that these pillars of the habit world cause \"small wins\" and \"allow other habits to flourish by [architecting] new structures.\" As this pertains to Diarist, we want this once-a-day journaling to be the keystone habit for the goal or process or skill that the user wants to attain. It would not directly cause it but rather follow like this: A man wants to be a blues guitarist, so the writing would help him (this is the part that the keystone habit causes ->>) anaylze his progress and push him to continue, both emotionally &amp; subject-wise. As for when to record, when to write, the interface needs to be as easy to open as TextEdit. I often record when I feel a \"spark\", or an interesting instance where the resource connects with my subject (particularly a preexisting question). I write when I can quite literreally feel the connections form in my brain, these \"coherent &amp; exciting moments of mental and physical inspiration\"\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg\n        <br></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/16 Monday - Preliminary Research <br />\nOn Habits &amp; Specific Rules</p>\n\n<p>B.J. Fogg on Habits <br />\n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8</a></p>\n\n<p>This talk was really great, it offered new views on habit other than Duhigg's  loops which I sorely need. It also points out many of the traditional problems with methods of changing habits.</p>\n\n<p>He begins with a description of a small change and reward. To me, a rediculously small change and a silly reward. I do not know whether or not this common troupe in the global habit change discussion is purely used to illustrate a point or whether a man that teaches at Stanford really believes that minute increments and pats on the back are really the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>He claims, like Duhigg, that using motivation and sheer willpower as \"cues\" and \"rewards\" is a losing strategy. I do not entirely disagree, but both of these things are nessicary for the long haul, as motivators of change. Maybe Fogg can transition from the rediculousness of doing pushups after he uses the toilet. Habits may be somewhat systematic and need to be made automatic, but they are also organic and require a certain grace to execute. I cannot justify a routine if the cue and reward are meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>When Fogg begins to talk about Weight Loss and the myriad of associated habits or behaviors that must be changed in order to lose weight, he touches on Diarist \"chapters\". Small wins must fall between the chapters as they act as big wins. Weight Loss is the question we want you to ask, and the chapters are the many steps to get there. He mentions stress reduction, diet and excerise to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>Baby steps with grace &amp; meaning limit the amount of backsliding that may happen. You come to Diarist with the motivation, and we help you overcome the gap in ability. Not specifically, but by setting up a structure that allows you to do it yourself and will limit chance for failure, burnout &amp; all other associated pitfalls. The structure most importantly supports and increases motivation. Although, rewards may be backsliding. 6 days and a cheat day.</p>\n\n<p>This is what a cue is comprised of, and Fogg hits this right on the head: adiquite motivation, ability &amp; a trigger. More of the specifics of his model can be found at: <a href='http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html'>http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In the case of \"tiny habits\" as Fogg presents them, he says much like Duhigg: using existing cues and replacing the routine works. Fogg suggests replacing the already small routine with a yet smaller one, increasing the likeliness that we will do it according to his motivation vs. skill chart.</p>\n\n<p>Back to Duhigg: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voX0gUn_JOI'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voX0gUn_JOI</a></p>\n\n<p>He shines a light on the extrinsic means for the internal reward. At first, he says, cues and rewards must be external enough to trick the brain. Eventually they may fade into internal feelings in liu of the external reward which once provided those feelings.</p>\n\n<p>He also goes into depth about the mechanics of habits of the individual and how groups support them emotionally. He says that intellectually we may be able to tell that we can change, but groups are important in moments of weakness.</p>\n\n<p>AT 22:00 he talks about food journaling and how the process and repitition of documenting a process can lead you to avoidence of mistakes and progress. They learn their own patterns. Avoiding stupidity rather than being brilliant - Charlie Munger. He points out that willpower is easily taxed. Willpower is not used when actions are habitualized.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/17 Tuesday - Preliminary Research <br />\nMotivation &amp; Habits Specifics</p>\n\n<p><a href='http://blog.greatcodeclub.com/learn-new-things/'>http://blog.greatcodeclub.com/learn-new-things/</a> <br />\nA great blog &amp; resource to help developers take on side projects. A few great quotes here:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"However, my goal was never to learn how programming languages work. My goal was to create one, so I had to learn. I think this is very important. Learning for the sake of learning never worked for me, but learning because I wanted to do something with that knowledge did.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This post comes close to the proposed Diarist way of small wins journaling. The rules at the end are indespensable too. Yesterday, I remember an important thing that I forgot to write down. A habit for around a month usually cements it.</p>\n\n<p>Two rules what have helped me are: ones from Leo Babatua \"Make it a rule never to skip two days in a row.\" and one from freshman English 101, \"always allows yourself to spew a 'shitty first draft'\", editing on-the-go restricts the flow of ideas. These really have to do with both the app itself (what it gives to the user) and the flow (the meta, what the app is trying to achieve)</p>\n\n<p>Babauta's list on his blog Zen Habits is a great summary of all the things I have discussed or in some capacity learned so far. <a href='http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-4/'>http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-4/</a> <br />\nI felt good knowing that I could still learn from each of the points without seeing them as something completely new. It seems that what is coming soon is application of these points about habits and its processes into an app flow. Then, before learning MEAN &amp; web app architechture I need to validate my idea with actual users.</p>\n\n<p>A great place to look for further info would be Tim Ferriss &amp; his books. As inspired by his \"Day In the Life Of...\" <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV2hLYqRnvY'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV2hLYqRnvY</a>.</p>\n\n<p>6/18 Wednesday - Preliminary Research <br />\nClean-Up, Learning Curves &amp; RAS</p>\n\n<p>Did a little resource hunting today and transferring of ideas from numerous text edit files to this blog.</p>\n\n<p>Kaufmen debunks the 10,000 hour rule. Found this to be encouraging. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY</a> <br />\nAt 8:00 he talks about learning curves. Gives a great graph. Reinforces what I have learned so far, which is great because I know that I am on the right track.</p>\n\n<p>He says it takes 20 hours to break the curve, via <b> rapid skill aquisition </b>. More definitley needs to be looked at on this topic. Tim Ferriss would be great. MAGICAL words after 10:00.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/19 Thursday - Preliminary Research</p>\n\n<p>Began Start Small, Stay Small by Walling. He avoids the venture-capital buisness-y startup lingo and communicates from a developers POV which is good. He stresses niche market, which I have read time and time again. I will need to target Diarist at a specific group. This can happen with the subjects. If we start the community with say, health and fitness/barefoot runners (super specific) and electronic music producers? Were going out \"two or three descriptors\" black barefoot runners, dubstep edm producers, ect... </p>\n\n<p>After reading, I should probably fill in this sentance: \"A skill &amp; habit mastery tool for &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;\". I think it would be neat to either advertise or begin with 2 subjects like this: \"A rapid skill aquisition tool for weightliters and web developers\" or for \"barefoot runners and banjo players\". I think <b>rapid skill aquisition tool without any spoonfeeding or hard framework </b> is really at the heart of Diarist. </p>\n\n<p>We can really feed off of anti-self help, that is spoonfeed-y, non-universal, rigid and cheesy material, in favor of \"increased learning, your way\" in a kind of guarenteed results vibe. Guarenteed results if you do your subject &amp; write every day, or according to the schedule that you post (eminating keystone habit). This would be the only rigid part to the system. Helping with the RSA process via education &amp; a framework involving habit, RSA, willpower, ect (all of the latest research) <b>and</b> their chosen subject. The latter will mainly lie in encourangement, connection with the community &amp; suggestions from Diarist.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder: RAS pointed at amateurs with motivation, without telling them that they are amateurs. We dont want to target people who already have these skills. Remember, when they come to Diarist, they need to supply the motivation. The resevour of \"i want to change\", not laziness.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/20 Friday - Preliminary Research, App Flow <br />\nConsolidating Ideas from TextEdit Notes</p>\n\n<p>As well as this primarily being a RAS tool, the what differentiates it from other systems is its dependance on the keystone habit: diary writing. For the community at large, the individual journies (diarys) bring a sense of unity, through the personal writing, to particularly difficult projects. As this pertains to guides and instructions on the internt: typically one must undergo struggle and then upon realization of their initial question or goal, they must synthesize a guide out of completion, often losing the personal journey &amp; minute details that come during the journey to the answer. It is not the answer but the journey that counts, the journey is what makes the end unique. </p>\n\n<p>A user might first approach Diarist like this: I want to delve into the subject or learn this skill, <br />\nbut it has a large learning curve &amp; I don’t know where to begin (what resources to look at, who to ask, what tools to use…) Again Diarist seems to be a great idea for multifaceted projects (those that seem overpowering and insurmountable) where multiple subjects/trade secrets/ect are involved, and not so great for surface level, specific questions (i.e. how do I release an album, how do I produce electronic music).</p>\n\n<p>On app flow: Posts include thoughts/setbacks/progress in the form of prose, video or pictures. This is day based, timeline based. Through this method of posting “small wins”, the emphasis is on a personal chronicle of struggle and success. The posting interface and service as a whole ties them together &amp; spurs additional progress. “What I used, how I used it, what was the end product of me using it (ie. what did i learn, how did I feel about using it, how did this progress me towards my greater goal)” essentially self reflection intertwined with expository writing. </p>\n\n<p>Also, to spur progress Diarist could have awards: \"Forger Award - first to complete a diary about this\" Emails could look like: Here is what other people have said about this: <br />\n- on diarist<br>\n- on specific internet resources<br>\n- on google<br>\n- in non-internet resources<br><br>\nthese resources lead somewhere. <br />\nAfter diary begins, video masterclass on progress</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/21 &amp; 6/22 Saturday, Sunday - Tidying Up &amp; Expanding Posts (Streamlining &amp; Wrap Up Idea Synthesis)</p>\n\n<p>Leaving posts raw.

I think this will be one of the keys to successful marketing & learning curve conquest, however, not the focus of the entire app. There is a whole no-man's-land after the curve that we need to fulfill, but I think that RSA principles combined with the keystone habit of the daily diary metric will fill in a lot of the details of the gap.\n\nOne of the essential parts of getting people to go along with this system is providing them with education on the process itself and the ways in which they should make progress. For instance, learning about learning (LAL). How do I know which skills I need to learn to get to my end goal. Essentially, this will be RSA over and over again between sub-goals to get to the end.\n\n___\n\nTuesday 6/24 - Market Validation\nNiches & Overall Goal\n\nMy journey today began with an email from Fizzle, \"Why Finding Your Niche is Just Plain Bad Advice.\" It turns out that the niche idea itself needed to be redefined to target a psychographic within a demographic. The first is what you shoot for, the second is the general area in which you market. This way, you never lose the market say if the 13 year old girl you once marketed towards becomes a 30 year old mom. Their ambitions may not always be the same, but old attachments/dreams/passions die hard.\n\nThe author then addresses a very minimalist view towards amassing an audience or getting people to pay attention. I the applicable steps in summary are these:\n1. Make a good product/content around a certain niche (redefined to \"worldview\")\n2. Connect with people in the niche, \"leverage their platforms.\"\n\n\nThe steps in market validation, or making sure that the market exists, is large enough and that your product will be well received are:\n1. If you want to be Betty Crocker, first set up a lemonade stand. Create a rough draft or even a picture of the rough draft, with all of the initial marketing built in. An example of this would be a site that allows a hype-y sneak peak, gives a release date and then collects a contact email. Think kickstarter. It would then provide constant updates, maybe a link to this blog?\n2. Direct people to the site.\n\n#####Dialing things back a bit\nThe idea for Diarist is not fully formed, and it is overwhelming me. Here is what I do know:\n>There will be a web application that I write in some capacity.\n\n>There is a system or one or two (habit loops, RSA) that can be combined, exploited, and stripped into a framework to be molded into said app.\n\n>This system of daily, Diarist based writing as a keystone habit is working for me. The weekends as a concession, cheat-day also works marvelously.\n\n>Most importantly and most certainly, the market that I need to focus on is the \"lifehacker\", the rapid skill acquisition & habit changing self-experimenters, those who are willing to work & be aided (shortcutters), not the lazy. The 4HWW & I Will Teach You To Be Rich crowd. Even those that would read the Power of Habit! Self-improvement, not self-help. \n\nThe habit loop of my diary writing:\n1. Trigger: A lull in work & a \"remember to do\" thought.\n2. Routine: Research & writing (simultaneously)\n3. Reward: Feeling of accomplishment, guiltless play.\n4. Craving: For Meaning.\n\n___\n\nWednesday 6/25 - Preliminary Research\nRefocusing & RSA Frameworks\n\nDiarist probably needs to be renamed, but for now, we refocus to an RSA app. I'd say that the next few steps are to identify common frameworks for this and it's outlying dependancies, deconstruct them and apply them.\n\nAt its core, Diarist will boil down (framework) and put into app form the leading \"systems\" on skill acquisition. When finished with the acquisition, the user will be able to have that acquisition (put into guide form by the app) associated with him and broadcast into the community for glory. He will be able to track how many people have used his methods, either the entire guide or specific parts, say, his 1 of his 3 Minimum Effective Doses. The community will be connected in this way, and will drive the app through the competitive, motivated and demanding nature of its users. The idea is no longer a long term project tracker, but a fast pace race against the clock, or yourself in this case.\n\nI am still into the idea of daily tracking, but no doubt any RSA system will prescribe such a daily check in. It largely depends on the framework that we come up with. Daily tracking could be any type of media or format of writing (bullets, paragraphs, ect..)\n\nAs for development, the MEAN stack will be too complicated. A conversation with my boss and friend lead me to the KISS acronym. Keep it simple stupid! Too many difficult learning curves at once will destroy my ambition to complete this project.\n\nMEAN is a stack, and I don't really need a stack of separate languages when I am trying to learn web app fundamentals and construct a basic web app. Upon a recommendation from a friend. I will now use Parse + Backbone.js (Backend), JQuery (Middleware) and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (Frontend). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ATktgoXu9s\n\nFor the initial app flow, I will keep in mind the absolute minimum amount of functionality needed to implement the very basic idea of the app.\n\nBack to the building metaphor if the building is the overall accomplishment, the app definitely needs to provide the scaffolding, the user provides the workers and I am undecided on whether we are to provide the food and praise sustain the workers (motivation by way of habit loops, \"internet points\"/incentivization, ect..).\n\nAs for different RSA systems I know of these so far:\nTim Ferriss - DSSS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzyvvkiUIKY\nJosh Kaufman - First 20 Hours\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB6K60mkmho\nhttp://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-acquire-any-new-skill-in-20-hours-or-less/\nMalcolm Gladwell - 10,000 Hours in \"Outliers\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k4kv2xW7JM\nRandom Hodge-podge of Blogs\nhttp://lifehacker.com/the-science-behind-how-we-learn-new-skills-908488422\n\n\n\n\nExpanding on marketing:\nDo more, work less. Essentially we need to remove everything about the acquisition process so that all there is left to do is the leg work. Like putting blinders on a horse, it does not tell the horse where to go, but narrows the path so that the chances of him getting there greatly increase. The end goal will not be to become expert, but to become adequate. So that they \"Know what they're doing.\"\n\n___\n\n6/26 Thursday - App Flow\nFerriss Framework: DiSSS & CaFE\n\nThese frameworks proposed by Ferriss, Kaufmen and to a certain extent Gladwell, all have nessecarily the same steps and are basically mental \"frameworks\". It would probably benefit me to read more about Munger's mental models, as they seem to be useful and similar in wading through these RSA systems. My job will be to give representation in an app for what happens explicitly in the framework and appropriately guide what happens implicitly for the user, making it all interactive so all that is left is the leg work.\n\nPage 38 in the 4HChef is the perfect framework. Ferriss sets up DiSSS as the explicit framework and CaFE (and earlier remarks about emotional blockage, fear, ect..) as the implicit mental happenings that specifically aid the legwork. \n\n1. User enters all of the \"minimum learnable units\"\n2. User selects the most important of the units\n3. User orders these important units\n4. User sets up stakes\n\nSay that 1,2,3 are the beginning, the leg work (CaFE) happens in the middle, and 4 is realized at the end. The user basically defines the beginning and end of the project first and then fills in the gaps.\n\nUsers also need to set up CaFE, especially frequency. This will allow the app to remind them and send them resources. \n\nI believe that the learnable units and stakes will play the largest role in the community aspect of this, which is really becoming increasingly important. The overall topic and learnable units are community links because they are suggested and searchable, maybe one gets awarded for using less or more unique units? The stakes motivate the competitive and urgency aspects of the user and community. The user is simple enough, when they finish a unit, they can record their progress and be rewarded with validation to the community, metrics about how pieces of their progression is being used by the community, achievements, points, ect... How stakes as they relate to a unit or a whole skill are going to integrate with the community, I don't know. We don't want users to be pitted against each other like: \"You and Bill will run the La Jolla Half Marathon in 2 months\", this is to blatant of an accountabilibuddy. At some level there needs to be approval or disapproval from the community about what the members of it are doing in their personal skill trees.\n\nInstead of blogging in between the units, the user is only prompted to share information or validate that he has completed that unit, when he has completed the unit. No mandatory intermediate posts.\n\nThere is a skeleton framework, listed above that will be the core of the app. But, RSA is as much dependent on the framework as well as the mindset, there is a highly demanding mental part of doing the least amount for the most gain. Whether this instruction is integrated with the core or proposed as a \"tutorial\", since we are already gamifying with the community and the stakes, i do not know.\n\nBy the way, skills or entire subjects need to be \"two nouns out\". This means that Learning Japanese is not good. Learning All of the Japanese Kanji is good. Playing guitar is not good. Playing Blues guitar is good. Remember that this is not a prolonged-research project, it is a semi-specific, fast paced, competitive, amateur (in the vein of Kaufmen), rapid skill acquisition. This is NOT a project guide or mastery of a skill. This app would be good, say in this situation for learning my \"Web App with Parse & Backbone.js\" section. Even build a web app would be fine, not create a top 100 app from scratch. Skill, not project based. Most of these rules need to be implicit in the design of the program, there should not be \"learn all this stuff\" to use my app to \"learn more stuff.\"\n\n####Groundwork & Deconstruction\n> To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. - Abraham Maslow\n\n>When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles - John T. Reed\n\nThis will the the process of breaking apart the skill into the minimum learnable units. Finding these is the difficult part, which will be either taught or integrated into the app. I vote for integration, but I lack ideas about how to do this currently. Anyway, there are specific mental models or \"deconstructors\" or tools by which to deconstruct that you can run the skill through and out will pop the parts. There are obviously many more, but I see 5 right now. It is necessary to stress that some of these may work for some skills and not for others. This section could greatly expand upon integration Munger's models and [Farnam Street's models](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/).\n\nBefore addressing the models, information needs to be provided on finding materials on the skill from which to deconstruct the units. The user needs to have information on the groundwork for their subject. Maybe we instruct the user to find some authoritative or classic resources on the skill? Suggestions should be pulled for them. Again, little tricks can be provided for example:\n- Read overview materials, look for top rated books on the skill on Google or Amazon.\n- Look at the author's bibliography or keep an eye out for any mention of leading or classic resources\n- Youtube\n- Look for leading content.\n\nReduction: The common parts between many things. This works well for numerous instances of memorization. Japanese characters, dance routines, blues songs. For example in every blues song there is usually certain common chords, certain common progressions and certain common licks. Learning 3 blues boxes or scales could yield infinite popular blues licks.\n\nInversion:\n\nTranslation:\n\nNegation: What a bad person does.\n\nInterview or \"Expert-Watching\": \n\nThese units are \"Action-centric\" (Principles) not \"Thing-centric\" (Specifics). For instance: DO: time yourself while tying knots, aim to get faster with each time. NOT: learn to tie a hookydoodle knot.\n\n\"Thing-centric\" units are valid, but should be reserved and separated from the minimum learnable units, as simply learning a square knot is extremely beneficial to the knot tying discipline, as is buying rope. How these will be integrated with the system, just as a list of resources and applications, has yet to be determined.\n\nPresumably these units have already been internalized or read in the pre-deconstruction stage of resource finding. \n\n\"Thing-centric\" units limit the user from personalizing the process and separate them from the process itself, which will probably lead to failure. However if there is some must read book on knot tying, it is probably important.\n\nWhat and why professional knot tiers are doing what they are doing is more concerning than the specifics of how they are doing it.\n\n\n####Selection\nIs what covers the most ground. If you were looking at a linear representation with the skill on a line with amateur and expert on either end, what did they do that allowed them to cover the most ground on the line? What are the biggest small wins?\n\n\n####More Proposed Resources relating to RSA:\n\n- The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance \n\n- The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning\n\n- Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger, 3rd Edition\n\n- [The Makings of An Expert - Anders Ericsson](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/ericsson2007a.pdf)\n\n- The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills\n\n- The Road To Excellence: The Acquisition of Expert Performance in the Arts and Sciences, Sports, and Games\n\n\nBy reading these books, we will identify what methods are similar and overlap in getting to  an amateur status and a master status. Figuring out what is the MED for amateurism, that mimics those methods that masters use? \n\n___\n\n5/27 Friday - Preliminary Research\n\n> Learning to program is like learning to write good natural language. The best way to do it is to read some stuff written by masters of the form, write some things yourself, read a lot more, write a little more, read a lot more, write some more ... and repeat until your writing begins to develop the kind of strength and economy you see in your models. - Eric Steven Raymond in [How to Become a Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)\n\nAn essay for programmers similar to Gladwell's 10,000 hours, http://norvig.com/21-days.html\n\nA great summary of the beginning of Kaufmen's book by Ramit Sethi, http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-acquire-any-new-skill-in-20-hours-or-less/\n\nFor web app flow, http://bitovi.com/blog/2014/06/web-app-theory.html\n\nMore on the skill declaring, my two nouns out thing is covered in Kaufman's \"Target Performance Level\". The TAL is set after the skill, this is often what is two or three nouns out more importantly \"what is achievable for the amateur you!\". The skill declaration is general: \"Doing yoga.\" TAL is digging deeply and realistically, \"I want to set up a personal, at-home yoga practice.\"\n\nThe units are subskills, achieving these subskills is motivated by frequency ie habit loops.\n\nImportant terms to define will be learnable units (whether they are subskills or what! CLEARLY), skill declaration and TAL.","html":"<h5 id=\"chapters\">Chapters:</h5>\n\n<p>Preliminary Research <br />\nApp Flow/Wireframing (Framework) <br />\nMilestone: Initial Marketing Site <br />\nMarket Validation <br />\nWeb App (Backend) Basics w/ Parse &amp; Backbone.js <br />\nDevelopment Phase 1</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Monday 6/23 - Preliminary Research <br />\nRSA + LAL</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know and with a quick Google search, there are no existing RSA apps. I think this will be one of the keys to successful marketing &amp; learning curve conquest, however, not the focus of the entire app. There is a whole no-man's-land after the curve that we need to fulfill, but I think that RSA principles combined with the keystone habit of the daily diary metric will fill in a lot of the details of the gap.</p>\n\n<p>One of the essential parts of getting people to go along with this system is providing them with education on the process itself and the ways in which they should make progress. For instance, learning about learning (LAL). How do I know which skills I need to learn to get to my end goal. Essentially, this will be RSA over and over again between sub-goals to get to the end.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Tuesday 6/24 - Market Validation <br />\nNiches &amp; Overall Goal</p>\n\n<p>My journey today began with an email from Fizzle, \"Why Finding Your Niche is Just Plain Bad Advice.\" It turns out that the niche idea itself needed to be redefined to target a psychographic within a demographic. The first is what you shoot for, the second is the general area in which you market. This way, you never lose the market say if the 13 year old girl you once marketed towards becomes a 30 year old mom. Their ambitions may not always be the same, but old attachments/dreams/passions die hard.</p>\n\n<p>The author then addresses a very minimalist view towards amassing an audience or getting people to pay attention. I the applicable steps in summary are these: <br />\n1. Make a good product/content around a certain niche (redefined to \"worldview\") <br />\n2. Connect with people in the niche, \"leverage their platforms.\"</p>\n\n<p>The steps in market validation, or making sure that the market exists, is large enough and that your product will be well received are: <br />\n1. If you want to be Betty Crocker, first set up a lemonade stand. Create a rough draft or even a picture of the rough draft, with all of the initial marketing built in. An example of this would be a site that allows a hype-y sneak peak, gives a release date and then collects a contact email. Think kickstarter. It would then provide constant updates, maybe a link to this blog? <br />\n2. Direct people to the site.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"dialingthingsbackabit\">Dialing things back a bit</h5>\n\n<p>The idea for Diarist is not fully formed, and it is overwhelming me. Here is what I do know:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There will be a web application that I write in some capacity.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a system or one or two (habit loops, RSA) that can be combined, exploited, and stripped into a framework to be molded into said app.</p>\n  \n  <p>This system of daily, Diarist based writing as a keystone habit is working for me. The weekends as a concession, cheat-day also works marvelously.</p>\n  \n  <p>Most importantly and most certainly, the market that I need to focus on is the \"lifehacker\", the rapid skill acquisition &amp; habit changing self-experimenters, those who are willing to work &amp; be aided (shortcutters), not the lazy. The 4HWW &amp; I Will Teach You To Be Rich crowd. Even those that would read the Power of Habit! Self-improvement, not self-help. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The habit loop of my diary writing: <br />\n1. Trigger: A lull in work &amp; a \"remember to do\" thought. <br />\n2. Routine: Research &amp; writing (simultaneously) <br />\n3. Reward: Feeling of accomplishment, guiltless play. <br />\n4. Craving: For Meaning.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Wednesday 6/25 - Preliminary Research <br />\nRefocusing &amp; RSA Frameworks</p>\n\n<p>Diarist probably needs to be renamed, but for now, we refocus to an RSA app. I'd say that the next few steps are to identify common frameworks for this and it's outlying dependancies, deconstruct them and apply them.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, Diarist will boil down (framework) and put into app form the leading \"systems\" on skill acquisition. When finished with the acquisition, the user will be able to have that acquisition (put into guide form by the app) associated with him and broadcast into the community for glory. He will be able to track how many people have used his methods, either the entire guide or specific parts, say, his 1 of his 3 Minimum Effective Doses. The community will be connected in this way, and will drive the app through the competitive, motivated and demanding nature of its users. The idea is no longer a long term project tracker, but a fast pace race against the clock, or yourself in this case.</p>\n\n<p>I am still into the idea of daily tracking, but no doubt any RSA system will prescribe such a daily check in.

UNDER GENERAL LEARNING:\n\n>Ranked for importance\n___\nTuesday - 7/1\n\nImportant question of the day is: What resources did Ferriss and Kaufman use? This could lead me towards more academic, research based systems, which is what I need!\n>Maybe I should take my own advice & look at their bibliographies...\n\nHere is another batch of resources to look into: will help with the app design. \"Instructional Design\" specifically, Design For How People Learn (Voices That Matter) by Dirksen.\n\n####Kaufman:\n“VanLehn, Kurt. “Cognitive Skill Acquisition.” Annual Review of Psychology 47, no. 1 (1996): 513–539.”\n\n“Newell, Allen, and Paul S. Rosenbloom. “Mechanisms of Skill Acquisition and the Law of Practice.” Cognitive Skills and Their Acquisition (1981): 1–55.”\n\n\"Feynman Technique\"\n\nSwitching gears to marketing:\nI think it is just about time that we gain market validation. To see if we need to go back to the drawing board. I propose simply making a product homepage \"update you when we are ready\", set a tentative alpha date, get there information (email), provide incentive to sign up, tell about features ect. 4HWW would be good for this, also http://blog.gumroad.com/post/75142076006/anatomy-of-an-effective-product-page. There are really two levels to this: marketing and design.\n\nHybrid app/RSA course?\n\n### Curve\n####Curve is a skill aquisition framework built to help normal people do extrodinary things. \n\nOur hope is that by harnessing the latest research by academics, authors, and bloggers alike, we will be able to build a strong community that will push the boundaries of learning. The framework is only half the battle, we need you.\n\nHelp us consider the \"learning curve\" a thing of the past. \n\nMade sales test site wireframe\n\n\n___\nWednesday - 7/2\nDomains & Measuring Demand\n\ncurvatu.re would be a pretty cool domain name. Or just some version of curveapp. \n\nThe \"Start Small, Stay Small\" book & 4HWW both have similar and great ideas for measuring demand. My main strategy will be to build a small marketing site and see how many people I can get to \"opt-in\". I should clearly identify where \"lifehacker\" types hang out & blogs that they might read. Off the top of my head I would go for Tim Ferriss' blog, Zen Habits, Lifehacker, reddit, hackernews ect. Then I need to direct traffic to my site through ads, but more likely guest articles and championing by others to \"measure demand\". Previously, I can use adwords & other keyword tools. Definitly needs to have conversion trackers on the site.\n\n####Current Research Reading:\nThe Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning\n\nThe Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance \n\nBuilding Expertise - Cognitive Methods for Training and Performance Improvement by Ruth Clark (ebrary)\n\nThe Creative Habit by Twyla Tharp\n\n\nMay use Meteor.js instead of Parse. Looks newer and transparently uses the MEAN stack, instead of the \"behind closed doors\" feel or Parse or Firebase. Eww firebase...\n\nMeteor takes care of Express & Angular, thank god, leaving only their special implimentation of Mongo (MiniMongo) & Node.js. I need to learn about document (JSON) databases (NoSQL) before I begin. High hopes though.\n\nNeed to find effective web app mockups for the marketing mini site. The list of crowdfunding sites that this guy has are golden for finding short app marketing pitches & mockups. http://www.apptamin.com/blog/get-funding-mobile-app/\n\nAlso this:\nhttp://www.apptamin.com/blog/create-your-apps-website-before-your-first-line-of-code/\n\n...speaks for itself.\n___\nThursday - 7/3\nApp Flow\n\nJust transferring paper notes now...\nSome slogans:\n\"Learn more, do less\"\n\"A framwork for rapid skill aquisition\"\n\"An api for life\"\n\nI was pretty fond of the last one, so It kind of spurred an idea. What if we split Curve into two parts a la an api and a program made with it. Obviously we cannot make it \"cheesily\" code based: deconstructSkill(); but I believe it would be intelligent to nod our head to successful APIs and the ways that they are put together. \n\nIn my head, the framework is comprise of two things the interactive skill interface and the educative element (the docs). The two will play heavily off of eachother, especially from interface -> docs. I decided that we will let users take care of any subject specific material, we will really only provide resources on the \"meta\" of it all. In this way, users must be able to use MED's or Subskills that belong to other users. Another cool thing would be for any changes or material by users to be commited to the docs immediately (async w/ Meteor!). So that the docs contain both the \"meta-learning\" info and material/best practices organized by subject. Anything inputted by the user will be \"highly modualar\" and availible for use by the community.\n\nAs far as what goes into the docs, I imagine in the vein of APIs we have sections and forms of usage (predetermined \"methods\" - models, heuristics, best practices and/or just general info). For example under the \"Deconstruction\" section we could have various models and their usages to create MEDs, and under \"Target Application Level\" we just have a definition and examples. Examples will be key for all.\n\nSome thoughts on Skill defining for the user, we should have a Subject, Skill, Target approach. That is: what general catagory the skill falls under, what the skill is (two nouns out), what the user's target application is. Ex: Programming, \"I want to learn server-side code\", \"I want to make a multi-user prototype of the Curve web app with Meteor.js (MEAN)\".\n\nSome thoughts on the opt in. We will have Closed Alpha and Open Beta for the stages of user \"population\"/bug fixes and subject specific content creation. Users that opt in within the mini site period will be invited to closed alpha, a basic features and information prototype. It is very important that they are introduced as the \"first\" that matter very much, we need to build a strong community or power users. Open Beta will be an open beta, with all of the three goals in mind, but with user leniency (they are scouting for bugs and creating content) and new alpha-distinct features. \n\nThis is important: http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-19/\n\nZen Habits is another phenominal source along with the Minimalists for blog style RSA. They should be added as a close second to Ferriss and Kaufman\n\nAnother good resource to view marketing, apps, website setup: https://news.ycombinator.com/show\nAlmost better than HackerNews: http://www.producthunt.com/\n\nFantastic: http://blog.frontapp.com/hacker-news-techcrunch-and-product-hunt-which-is-most-effective-to-launch-your-product-2/\n\nAwesome: http://goodui.org/\n\n####Back to research:\nFrom the Handbook of Expert...\n\nCruve docs will essentially be a \"knowledge base\" as defined in Expert Systems (91). It will encompass factual knowledge about meta-learning, but its focus will be heuristic knowledge or flipping heuristics into facts (like Munger with his models). This knowledge is, \"experiental, more judgemental [intuition-al] knowledge of performance. Rarely discussed and largely individualistic.\" This is the cornerstone of Curve, to illicit heuristic knowledge from users about skills and help others to apply this knowledge. \"It is knowledge of good practice, good judgement, and plausible reasoning within the domain. It is the knowledge that underlies the art of good guessing.\"\n\n>\"Experience is a prerequisite to human expertise... expertise gained through experience can be codified in the knowledge base as rules, heuristics, definitions, taxonomies, prototypes, statstics of prior associations [and] previously solved cases.\"\n\nWhen I am ready to actually design the knowledge base, I need to come back to Part 3 (127) and basically read the book from there. \n\n####So far we have:\n#####Skill Declaration \n(Subject, Skill, Target)\n >\"A problem well stated is a problem half solved\"\n \n Docs: Lovability of skill choice\n\n#####Deconstruction \n(Distilling expertise - Finding other's \"best practices\", Defining subskills (What are the essential in between steps, subjects, ect, NOUN CENTRIC) these are a distillation of the actions (VERB CENTRIC - best practices) of the experts)\n\n#####Selection\n(Deals with thinning out deconstructive research, Grouping and 80/20ing subskills, Formation of *your* \"best practices\" on for each subskill (MEDs).

The only goal we have is to meet the sweet spot between time and aquisition based on your target. The curve is different for all people and all subjects. We do not encourage you to set the bar low or shoot for the stars, rather set a realistic goal and go for it.\n\n####An example of MEDs, subskills, and targets\n\nSubject: Fitness\n\nSkill: Weight Management\n\nTarget: I want to get back down to my pre pregancy weight of 130lbs.\n\nSubskills: (What are the most essential things that people successful at weight loss do to achieve their long term (target/skill) goals?):\n\n- Dietary Change\n- Cardio Exercise\n- Slow Cadence Weight Training\n\nMEDs: (What are the most effective, *repeatable* if possible, ways that people successful at weight loss achieve their short term (subskills) goals?):\n\n- Dietary Change: Consume 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. Ferriss uses protien shakes.\n- Cardio Exercise: Run a mile every two days.\n- Slow Cadence Weight Training: Five minutes of kettlebell swings twice a week.\n\n#####Work TODO: Mockups, Wireframes & *Marketing Mini Site*\n#####Home TODO: App Flow + Research\n___\nFriday - 7/4\nMore on Marketing\n\nAs far as marketing goes, I think that the two most important things are SEO and \"Hustle\".
