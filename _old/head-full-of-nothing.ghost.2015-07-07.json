I was dealing with [these](http://www.minnetonkamoccasin.com/Products/Detail/classic-moc) moccasins with a typical \"sewn-in\" sole as opposed to one that is glued on. I am unsure about dealing with glued on soles and what the process for those would be. The entire reason behind this project is that my soles had worn down over 6 months, enough to break the thread which unraveled the entire sole from the bottom of the shoe.\n####Examine old soles & determine replacements\nConsider thickness, and tread. I suggest you go with a sheet of vibram rubber, because you can cut the new soles in a perfect outline of the old. Ready-made soles may not match. I used a sheet of 6mm Vibram \"Cherry\" from [DIY Footwear](http://www.diyfootwear.com/vibram-cherry-6mm/).\n####Make shoe clamps\nTwo small pieces of plywood on either side of one clamp. You will need either two or four of these rigs. Two if you want to clamp the shoes together and you dont have more than two clamps, like me. Four if you are thorough and neat. \n> This and the car method of pressure will do a number on the leather if it seems fragile. You have been warned.\n    \n-----\n### Day 2: Resoling\n___________\n####Cut out replacement soles\nTrace your old soles onto the sheet of rubber. Take care so that you do not end up with two right soles like me!\n<br>\nLuckily for you, my mistake shows the ability of these methods of resoling to last, even with the bumpy, treaded side connected to the leather. Obviously, you want the flat, non-treaded side connected with the moccasin.\n####Clean moccasin bottoms\nRemove all debris. The first step to success is making the bottoms surgically clean. I used a combination of GooGone, a razor blade, a wire brush and sandpaper to make this happen. After this, if the bottoms are not already suede, brush them into suede with the wire brush. Give the bottoms a final, hard cleaning with wire brush repeatedly dipped in acetone. Use it very librally, you want the soles to be a bit damp when you glue them. The reason for acetone is that the new Barge Cement formula now lacks a certain ingredient & the acetone works to counteract this lack, making the bond stronger all while making the soles cleaner. Something about ketones.\n\n>####While wet with solvent and with good ventilation:\n\n\n####Apply cement to moc bottom and new sole, spread carefully and evenly with brush\nEmphasis on carefully, the glue dries a translucent yellowy white. If you get it all over the sides of your moccassins, they will literally look like you smeared boogers all over them.\n\n####Wait 5 minutes & apply second coat on both\n<br>\n\n####Wait 5 minutes & apply third liberal coat to only moc bottoms on the heels and toes\n<br>\n\n####Wait 20 minutes for tackiness & align soles with bottoms and stick together.\nPlease be advised you will only be able to do this once, there is little to no readjusting after you have touched them together.\n\n####Put towel over each shoe & beat with hammer/mallet (Bottom and top)\nSpecial attention to heels and toes. This will help solidify the bond so the soles do not move whatsoever during the pressure applied over the next day. One of the links in the sources section says to \"beat the hell out of them.\" Don't hold back!\n\n####Lay towels over the shoes and place under back tires of your car.\nAlternatively, you can make a shoemaker’s anvil or jury rig a clamping structure that allows for heavy, even distribution of pressure. I chose the car.\n<br>\nBack over the shoes so that they are covered (most importantly in the heel and middle). Please use towels to cover the shoes, and leave for 12 hrs. Remember, you are looking for heavy, even pressure.\n\n\n____\n###Day 3: Final Touches\n_______\nTake out from under car, clamp heels and toes of the shoes separately between your makeshift clamping rigs for another 12 hrs. After that, they are free to be worn.\n<br>\n\nReformation will take place over the next couple days of wear, seal any gaps that may form during this period between moc and sole with Shoe Goo. Gaps will usually form from inaccurate sole cuts or gluing, where the sole is bent up the side of the moc during wear. If you aligned the soles perfectly and applied an adiquiate amount of glue and pressure, then you should not have to do this. If you have a belt sander or Dremel handy, then use this to smooth out the edges of the soles and any innacuracies in placement.\n<br>\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n","html":"<blockquote>\n  <p>For increased durability &amp; ground feel, and\n  as a replacement for the shitty standard Minnetonka soles.

The idea was essentially spurred by the video below.\n\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/85040589\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/85040589\">THE GAP by Ira Glass</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/frohlocke\">frohlocke</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\n____\n\nGlass says, \"Your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you... Alot of people never get past that phase, alot of people at that point they quit.\" He goes on to say that in order to bridge that gap, between your taste and production, you must struggle through \"a large volume of work\".\n\nI applaud him for making this insight, but what can be said of this gap and the struggle? What keeps people from quitting? Glass has made us aware of the gap, but how does one overcome it?\n\nThere is truth in him saying, \"by moving through a large volume of work\". At a certain point, rote repitition is the only way to move past certain artistic blocks. For instance, when a person learning the guitar cannot switch chords fast enough; repition works especially well for physical limitation. This is well represented in sports, but the question remains: what if you have no coach. How does one sucessfully engage in independant practice without a stable source of knowledge? Repitition of disappointing work with little growth is literally the fast-track to becoming a sub-par artist. So when Ira asks us to produce a large volume of work, I say what work? How does one keep from perpetually disappointing themselves? \n\nGlass gives us awareness of the gap, and we have established that \"practice makes perfect\", but before anything, one must be able to choose the right work. This barrier to knowing the what and how and why of a subject is commonly referred to as a learning curve and is what Diarist seeks to remedy.\n\n####Awareness of the gap is only the very first step to overcoming it.\n\nBy blending small, diary style posting with a guide-esqe, expository assembly of the individual posts by the Diarist app, I hope to create courage in the face of this gap. \n\nI imaging the user's hands trembling, half in fear and half in excitement when they enter their \"diary\" name. A question, not impossible, but one that seems insurmountable. Users with no programming experience could enter \"I want to publish an iOS App\" or people with questionable writing could say, \"How to write a novel\" and they could trust in the Diarist community and the app itself to guide them.\n\nThe wealth of information created by the community of Diarists could take care of the specifics pertaining to each subject, but the application itself could provide a framework, incentive and a set of general beginning materials. Suggestions for sub-goals or \"chapters\" could be auto-suggested by the app, pulling from other diarys.\n\nHowever the only way to test this method of overcoming learning curves and to hone it is to take part in it myself. I will keep a daily journal on the development of this app beginning with the question: How do I create & publish a web application? With my first \"chapter\" as: App Flow & Prelimiary Research and second as: Web App Architecture & MEAN. \n\n____\n\n6/13 Friday - Preliminary Research\nThe Importance of Habit\n\t<br>Insight:\n    <br>When one does something alot within the confines of a habit loop, they learn to like it, they gain pleasure from it. They gain pleasure from the fufillment of the craving.\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg\n    \t<br>\n        \n6/14 Saturday - Preliminary Research\nDefinitions of Learning Curves\n\t<br>Insight:\n    <br>Learning curves are often exponential followed by a plateau. Habit and persistance are the driving forces behind the growth, the plateau afterword must be addressed but can be ignored for now, since we are focusing primarily on the struggle that comes with the initial curve. The struggle behind this \"steep\" curve can be identified as having to do with both the seeming insurmountablilty of the goal <b> and </b> the blistering, pummelling pace at which the initial learning comes. Refer to the x,y graph on the wiki resource.\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve\n    \t<br>\n___\n6/15 Sunday - Preliminary Research\nKeystone Habits\n\t<br>Insight:\n    <br>Duhigg refers to habits that lead to change in other aspects of life, or as catalysts for more positive actions: Keystone habits. He writes that these pillars of the habit world cause \"small wins\" and \"allow other habits to flourish by [architecting] new structures.\" As this pertains to Diarist, we want this once-a-day journaling to be the keystone habit for the goal or process or skill that the user wants to attain. It would not directly cause it but rather follow like this: A man wants to be a blues guitarist, so the writing would help him (this is the part that the keystone habit causes ->>) anaylze his progress and push him to continue, both emotionally & subject-wise. As for when to record, when to write, the interface needs to be as easy to open as TextEdit. I often record when I feel a \"spark\", or an interesting instance where the resource connects with my subject (particularly a preexisting question). I write when I can quite literreally feel the connections form in my brain, these \"coherent & exciting moments of mental and physical inspiration\"\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg\n    \t<br>\n    \n____\n    \n    \n6/16 Monday - Preliminary Research\nOn Habits & Specific Rules\n\nB.J. Fogg on Habits\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8\n\nThis talk was really great, it offered new views on habit other than Duhigg's  loops which I sorely need. It also points out many of the traditional problems with methods of changing habits.\n\nHe begins with a description of a small change and reward. To me, a rediculously small change and a silly reward. I do not know whether or not this common troupe in the global habit change discussion is purely used to illustrate a point or whether a man that teaches at Stanford really believes that minute increments and pats on the back are really the way to go.\n\nHe claims, like Duhigg, that using motivation and sheer willpower as \"cues\" and \"rewards\" is a losing strategy. I do not entirely disagree, but both of these things are nessicary for the long haul, as motivators of change. Maybe Fogg can transition from the rediculousness of doing pushups after he uses the toilet. Habits may be somewhat systematic and need to be made automatic, but they are also organic and require a certain grace to execute. I cannot justify a routine if the cue and reward are meaningless.\n\nWhen Fogg begins to talk about Weight Loss and the myriad of associated habits or behaviors that must be changed in order to lose weight, he touches on Diarist \"chapters\". Small wins must fall between the chapters as they act as big wins. Weight Loss is the question we want you to ask, and the chapters are the many steps to get there. He mentions stress reduction, diet and excerise to name a few.\n\nBaby steps with grace & meaning limit the amount of backsliding that may happen. You come to Diarist with the motivation, and we help you overcome the gap in ability. Not specifically, but by setting up a structure that allows you to do it yourself and will limit chance for failure, burnout & all other associated pitfalls. The structure most importantly supports and increases motivation. Although, rewards may be backsliding. 6 days and a cheat day.\n\nThis is what a cue is comprised of, and Fogg hits this right on the head: adiquite motivation, ability & a trigger. More of the specifics of his model can be found at: http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html\n\nIn the case of \"tiny habits\" as Fogg presents them, he says much like Duhigg: using existing cues and replacing the routine works. Fogg suggests replacing the already small routine with a yet smaller one, increasing the likeliness that we will do it according to his motivation vs. skill chart.\n\nBack to Duhigg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voX0gUn_JOI\n\nHe shines a light on the extrinsic means for the internal reward. At first, he says, cues and rewards must be external enough to trick the brain. Eventually they may fade into internal feelings in liu of the external reward which once provided those feelings.\n\nHe also goes into depth about the mechanics of habits of the individual and how groups support them emotionally. He says that intellectually we may be able to tell that we can change, but groups are important in moments of weakness.\n\nAT 22:00 he talks about food journaling and how the process and repitition of documenting a process can lead you to avoidence of mistakes and progress. They learn their own patterns. Avoiding stupidity rather than being brilliant - Charlie Munger. He points out that willpower is easily taxed. Willpower is not used when actions are habitualized.\n\n____\n6/17 Tuesday - Preliminary Research\nMotivation & Habits Specifics\n\nhttp://blog.greatcodeclub.com/learn-new-things/\nA great blog & resource to help developers take on side projects. A few great quotes here: \n>\"However, my goal was never to learn how programming languages work. My goal was to create one, so I had to learn. I think this is very important. Learning for the sake of learning never worked for me, but learning because I wanted to do something with that knowledge did.\"\n\nThis post comes close to the proposed Diarist way of small wins journaling. The rules at the end are indespensable too. Yesterday, I remember an important thing that I forgot to write down. A habit for around a month usually cements it.\n\nTwo rules what have helped me are: ones from Leo Babatua \"Make it a rule never to skip two days in a row.\" and one from freshman English 101, \"always allows yourself to spew a 'shitty first draft'\", editing on-the-go restricts the flow of ideas. These really have to do with both the app itself (what it gives to the user) and the flow (the meta, what the app is trying to achieve)\n\nBabauta's list on his blog Zen Habits is a great summary of all the things I have discussed or in some capacity learned so far. http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-4/\nI felt good knowing that I could still learn from each of the points without seeing them as something completely new. It seems that what is coming soon is application of these points about habits and its processes into an app flow. Then, before learning MEAN & web app architechture I need to validate my idea with actual users.\n\nA great place to look for further info would be Tim Ferriss & his books. As inspired by his \"Day In the Life Of...\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV2hLYqRnvY.\n\n6/18 Wednesday - Preliminary Research\nClean-Up, Learning Curves & RAS\n\nDid a little resource hunting today and transferring of ideas from numerous text edit files to this blog.\n\nKaufmen debunks the 10,000 hour rule. Found this to be encouraging. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY\nAt 8:00 he talks about learning curves. Gives a great graph. Reinforces what I have learned so far, which is great because I know that I am on the right track.\n\nHe says it takes 20 hours to break the curve, via <b> rapid skill aquisition </b>. More definitley needs to be looked at on this topic. Tim Ferriss would be great. MAGICAL words after 10:00.\n\n____\n\n6/19 Thursday - Preliminary Research\n\nBegan Start Small, Stay Small by Walling. He avoids the venture-capital buisness-y startup lingo and communicates from a developers POV which is good. He stresses niche market, which I have read time and time again. I will need to target Diarist at a specific group. This can happen with the subjects. If we start the community with say, health and fitness/barefoot runners (super specific) and electronic music producers? Were going out \"two or three descriptors\" black barefoot runners, dubstep edm producers, ect... \n\nAfter reading, I should probably fill in this sentance: \"A skill & habit mastery tool for ______\". I think it would be neat to either advertise or begin with 2 subjects like this: \"A rapid skill aquisition tool for weightliters and web developers\" or for \"barefoot runners and banjo players\". I think <b>rapid skill aquisition tool without any spoonfeeding or hard framework </b> is really at the heart of Diarist. \n\nWe can really feed off of anti-self help, that is spoonfeed-y, non-universal, rigid and cheesy material, in favor of \"increased learning, your way\" in a kind of guarenteed results vibe. Guarenteed results if you do your subject & write every day, or according to the schedule that you post (eminating keystone habit). This would be the only rigid part to the system. Helping with the RSA process via education & a framework involving habit, RSA, willpower, ect (all of the latest research) <b>and</b> their chosen subject. The latter will mainly lie in encourangement, connection with the community & suggestions from Diarist.\n\nI wonder: RAS pointed at amateurs with motivation, without telling them that they are amateurs. We dont want to target people who already have these skills. Remember, when they come to Diarist, they need to supply the motivation. The resevour of \"i want to change\", not laziness.\n\n____\n\n6/20 Friday - Preliminary Research, App Flow\nConsolidating Ideas from TextEdit Notes\n\nAs well as this primarily being a RAS tool, the what differentiates it from other systems is its dependance on the keystone habit: diary writing. For the community at large, the individual journies (diarys) bring a sense of unity, through the personal writing, to particularly difficult projects. As this pertains to guides and instructions on the internt: typically one must undergo struggle and then upon realization of their initial question or goal, they must synthesize a guide out of completion, often losing the personal journey & minute details that come during the journey to the answer. It is not the answer but the journey that counts, the journey is what makes the end unique. \n\nA user might first approach Diarist like this: I want to delve into the subject or learn this skill,\nbut it has a large learning curve & I don’t know where to begin (what resources to look at, who to ask, what tools to use…) Again Diarist seems to be a great idea for multifaceted projects (those that seem overpowering and insurmountable) where multiple subjects/trade secrets/ect are involved, and not so great for surface level, specific questions (i.e. how do I release an album, how do I produce electronic music).\n\nOn app flow: Posts include thoughts/setbacks/progress in the form of prose, video or pictures. This is day based, timeline based. Through this method of posting “small wins”, the emphasis is on a personal chronicle of struggle and success. The posting interface and service as a whole ties them together & spurs additional progress. “What I used, how I used it, what was the end product of me using it (ie. what did i learn, how did I feel about using it, how did this progress me towards my greater goal)” essentially self reflection intertwined with expository writing. \n\nAlso, to spur progress Diarist could have awards: \"Forger Award - first to complete a diary about this\" Emails could look like: Here is what other people have said about this:\n- on diarist<br>\n- on specific internet resources<br>\n- on google<br>\n- in non-internet resources<br><br>\nthese resources lead somewhere.\nAfter diary begins, video masterclass on progress\n\n___\n\n6/21 & 6/22 Saturday, Sunday - Tidying Up & Expanding Posts (Streamlining & Wrap Up Idea Synthesis)\n\nLeaving posts raw. Is this important? Probably.\n\nFor the future:\nMEAN Stack & Database Learning:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20605824/mean-stack-course-tutorial-node-js\n\nhttp://teamtreehouse.com/library/database-foundations\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Diarist is a web app that deals with learning curves.

What keeps people from quitting? Glass has made us aware of the gap, but how does one overcome it?</p>\n\n<p>There is truth in him saying, \"by moving through a large volume of work\". At a certain point, rote repitition is the only way to move past certain artistic blocks. For instance, when a person learning the guitar cannot switch chords fast enough; repition works especially well for physical limitation. This is well represented in sports, but the question remains: what if you have no coach. How does one sucessfully engage in independant practice without a stable source of knowledge? Repitition of disappointing work with little growth is literally the fast-track to becoming a sub-par artist. So when Ira asks us to produce a large volume of work, I say what work? How does one keep from perpetually disappointing themselves? </p>\n\n<p>Glass gives us awareness of the gap, and we have established that \"practice makes perfect\", but before anything, one must be able to choose the right work. This barrier to knowing the what and how and why of a subject is commonly referred to as a learning curve and is what Diarist seeks to remedy.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"awarenessofthegapisonlytheveryfirststeptoovercomingit\">Awareness of the gap is only the very first step to overcoming it.</h4>\n\n<p>By blending small, diary style posting with a guide-esqe, expository assembly of the individual posts by the Diarist app, I hope to create courage in the face of this gap. </p>\n\n<p>I imaging the user's hands trembling, half in fear and half in excitement when they enter their \"diary\" name. A question, not impossible, but one that seems insurmountable. Users with no programming experience could enter \"I want to publish an iOS App\" or people with questionable writing could say, \"How to write a novel\" and they could trust in the Diarist community and the app itself to guide them.</p>\n\n<p>The wealth of information created by the community of Diarists could take care of the specifics pertaining to each subject, but the application itself could provide a framework, incentive and a set of general beginning materials. Suggestions for sub-goals or \"chapters\" could be auto-suggested by the app, pulling from other diarys.</p>\n\n<p>However the only way to test this method of overcoming learning curves and to hone it is to take part in it myself. I will keep a daily journal on the development of this app beginning with the question: How do I create &amp; publish a web application? With my first \"chapter\" as: App Flow &amp; Prelimiary Research and second as: Web App Architecture &amp; MEAN. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/13 Friday - Preliminary Research <br />\nThe Importance of Habit <br />\n    <br>Insight:\n    <br>When one does something alot within the confines of a habit loop, they learn to like it, they gain pleasure from it.

Habit and persistance are the driving forces behind the growth, the plateau afterword must be addressed but can be ignored for now, since we are focusing primarily on the struggle that comes with the initial curve. The struggle behind this \"steep\" curve can be identified as having to do with both the seeming insurmountablilty of the goal <b> and </b> the blistering, pummelling pace at which the initial learning comes. Refer to the x,y graph on the wiki resource.\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve</a>\n        <br></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/15 Sunday - Preliminary Research <br />\nKeystone Habits <br />\n    <br>Insight:\n    <br>Duhigg refers to habits that lead to change in other aspects of life, or as catalysts for more positive actions: Keystone habits. He writes that these pillars of the habit world cause \"small wins\" and \"allow other habits to flourish by [architecting] new structures.\" As this pertains to Diarist, we want this once-a-day journaling to be the keystone habit for the goal or process or skill that the user wants to attain. It would not directly cause it but rather follow like this: A man wants to be a blues guitarist, so the writing would help him (this is the part that the keystone habit causes ->>) anaylze his progress and push him to continue, both emotionally &amp; subject-wise. As for when to record, when to write, the interface needs to be as easy to open as TextEdit. I often record when I feel a \"spark\", or an interesting instance where the resource connects with my subject (particularly a preexisting question). I write when I can quite literreally feel the connections form in my brain, these \"coherent &amp; exciting moments of mental and physical inspiration\"\n    <br><br>Resources:\n        <br>The Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg\n        <br></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/16 Monday - Preliminary Research <br />\nOn Habits &amp; Specific Rules</p>\n\n<p>B.J. Fogg on Habits <br />\n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8</a></p>\n\n<p>This talk was really great, it offered new views on habit other than Duhigg's  loops which I sorely need. It also points out many of the traditional problems with methods of changing habits.</p>\n\n<p>He begins with a description of a small change and reward. To me, a rediculously small change and a silly reward. I do not know whether or not this common troupe in the global habit change discussion is purely used to illustrate a point or whether a man that teaches at Stanford really believes that minute increments and pats on the back are really the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>He claims, like Duhigg, that using motivation and sheer willpower as \"cues\" and \"rewards\" is a losing strategy. I do not entirely disagree, but both of these things are nessicary for the long haul, as motivators of change. Maybe Fogg can transition from the rediculousness of doing pushups after he uses the toilet. Habits may be somewhat systematic and need to be made automatic, but they are also organic and require a certain grace to execute. I cannot justify a routine if the cue and reward are meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>When Fogg begins to talk about Weight Loss and the myriad of associated habits or behaviors that must be changed in order to lose weight, he touches on Diarist \"chapters\". Small wins must fall between the chapters as they act as big wins. Weight Loss is the question we want you to ask, and the chapters are the many steps to get there. He mentions stress reduction, diet and excerise to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>Baby steps with grace &amp; meaning limit the amount of backsliding that may happen. You come to Diarist with the motivation, and we help you overcome the gap in ability. Not specifically, but by setting up a structure that allows you to do it yourself and will limit chance for failure, burnout &amp; all other associated pitfalls. The structure most importantly supports and increases motivation. Although, rewards may be backsliding. 6 days and a cheat day.</p>\n\n<p>This is what a cue is comprised of, and Fogg hits this right on the head: adiquite motivation, ability &amp; a trigger. More of the specifics of his model can be found at: <a href='http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html'>http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In the case of \"tiny habits\" as Fogg presents them, he says much like Duhigg: using existing cues and replacing the routine works. Fogg suggests replacing the already small routine with a yet smaller one, increasing the likeliness that we will do it according to his motivation vs. skill chart.</p>\n\n<p>Back to Duhigg: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voX0gUn_JOI'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voX0gUn_JOI</a></p>\n\n<p>He shines a light on the extrinsic means for the internal reward. At first, he says, cues and rewards must be external enough to trick the brain. Eventually they may fade into internal feelings in liu of the external reward which once provided those feelings.</p>\n\n<p>He also goes into depth about the mechanics of habits of the individual and how groups support them emotionally. He says that intellectually we may be able to tell that we can change, but groups are important in moments of weakness.</p>\n\n<p>AT 22:00 he talks about food journaling and how the process and repitition of documenting a process can lead you to avoidence of mistakes and progress. They learn their own patterns. Avoiding stupidity rather than being brilliant - Charlie Munger. He points out that willpower is easily taxed. Willpower is not used when actions are habitualized.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/17 Tuesday - Preliminary Research <br />\nMotivation &amp; Habits Specifics</p>\n\n<p><a href='http://blog.greatcodeclub.com/learn-new-things/'>http://blog.greatcodeclub.com/learn-new-things/</a> <br />\nA great blog &amp; resource to help developers take on side projects. A few great quotes here:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"However, my goal was never to learn how programming languages work. My goal was to create one, so I had to learn. I think this is very important. Learning for the sake of learning never worked for me, but learning because I wanted to do something with that knowledge did.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This post comes close to the proposed Diarist way of small wins journaling. The rules at the end are indespensable too. Yesterday, I remember an important thing that I forgot to write down. A habit for around a month usually cements it.</p>\n\n<p>Two rules what have helped me are: ones from Leo Babatua \"Make it a rule never to skip two days in a row.\" and one from freshman English 101, \"always allows yourself to spew a 'shitty first draft'\", editing on-the-go restricts the flow of ideas. These really have to do with both the app itself (what it gives to the user) and the flow (the meta, what the app is trying to achieve)</p>\n\n<p>Babauta's list on his blog Zen Habits is a great summary of all the things I have discussed or in some capacity learned so far. <a href='http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-4/'>http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-4/</a> <br />\nI felt good knowing that I could still learn from each of the points without seeing them as something completely new. It seems that what is coming soon is application of these points about habits and its processes into an app flow. Then, before learning MEAN &amp; web app architechture I need to validate my idea with actual users.</p>\n\n<p>A great place to look for further info would be Tim Ferriss &amp; his books. As inspired by his \"Day In the Life Of...\" <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV2hLYqRnvY'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV2hLYqRnvY</a>.</p>\n\n<p>6/18 Wednesday - Preliminary Research <br />\nClean-Up, Learning Curves &amp; RAS</p>\n\n<p>Did a little resource hunting today and transferring of ideas from numerous text edit files to this blog.</p>\n\n<p>Kaufmen debunks the 10,000 hour rule. Found this to be encouraging. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY</a> <br />\nAt 8:00 he talks about learning curves. Gives a great graph. Reinforces what I have learned so far, which is great because I know that I am on the right track.</p>\n\n<p>He says it takes 20 hours to break the curve, via <b> rapid skill aquisition </b>. More definitley needs to be looked at on this topic. Tim Ferriss would be great. MAGICAL words after 10:00.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/19 Thursday - Preliminary Research</p>\n\n<p>Began Start Small, Stay Small by Walling. He avoids the venture-capital buisness-y startup lingo and communicates from a developers POV which is good. He stresses niche market, which I have read time and time again. I will need to target Diarist at a specific group. This can happen with the subjects. If we start the community with say, health and fitness/barefoot runners (super specific) and electronic music producers? Were going out \"two or three descriptors\" black barefoot runners, dubstep edm producers, ect... </p>\n\n<p>After reading, I should probably fill in this sentance: \"A skill &amp; habit mastery tool for &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;\". I think it would be neat to either advertise or begin with 2 subjects like this: \"A rapid skill aquisition tool for weightliters and web developers\" or for \"barefoot runners and banjo players\". I think <b>rapid skill aquisition tool without any spoonfeeding or hard framework </b> is really at the heart of Diarist. </p>\n\n<p>We can really feed off of anti-self help, that is spoonfeed-y, non-universal, rigid and cheesy material, in favor of \"increased learning, your way\" in a kind of guarenteed results vibe. Guarenteed results if you do your subject &amp; write every day, or according to the schedule that you post (eminating keystone habit). This would be the only rigid part to the system. Helping with the RSA process via education &amp; a framework involving habit, RSA, willpower, ect (all of the latest research) <b>and</b> their chosen subject. The latter will mainly lie in encourangement, connection with the community &amp; suggestions from Diarist.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder: RAS pointed at amateurs with motivation, without telling them that they are amateurs. We dont want to target people who already have these skills. Remember, when they come to Diarist, they need to supply the motivation. The resevour of \"i want to change\", not laziness.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/20 Friday - Preliminary Research, App Flow <br />\nConsolidating Ideas from TextEdit Notes</p>\n\n<p>As well as this primarily being a RAS tool, the what differentiates it from other systems is its dependance on the keystone habit: diary writing. For the community at large, the individual journies (diarys) bring a sense of unity, through the personal writing, to particularly difficult projects. As this pertains to guides and instructions on the internt: typically one must undergo struggle and then upon realization of their initial question or goal, they must synthesize a guide out of completion, often losing the personal journey &amp; minute details that come during the journey to the answer. It is not the answer but the journey that counts, the journey is what makes the end unique. </p>\n\n<p>A user might first approach Diarist like this: I want to delve into the subject or learn this skill, <br />\nbut it has a large learning curve &amp; I don’t know where to begin (what resources to look at, who to ask, what tools to use…) Again Diarist seems to be a great idea for multifaceted projects (those that seem overpowering and insurmountable) where multiple subjects/trade secrets/ect are involved, and not so great for surface level, specific questions (i.e. how do I release an album, how do I produce electronic music).</p>\n\n<p>On app flow: Posts include thoughts/setbacks/progress in the form of prose, video or pictures. This is day based, timeline based. Through this method of posting “small wins”, the emphasis is on a personal chronicle of struggle and success. The posting interface and service as a whole ties them together &amp; spurs additional progress. “What I used, how I used it, what was the end product of me using it (ie. what did i learn, how did I feel about using it, how did this progress me towards my greater goal)” essentially self reflection intertwined with expository writing. </p>\n\n<p>Also, to spur progress Diarist could have awards: \"Forger Award - first to complete a diary about this\" Emails could look like: Here is what other people have said about this: <br />\n- on diarist<br>\n- on specific internet resources<br>\n- on google<br>\n- in non-internet resources<br><br>\nthese resources lead somewhere. <br />\nAfter diary begins, video masterclass on progress</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>6/21 &amp; 6/22 Saturday, Sunday - Tidying Up &amp; Expanding Posts (Streamlining &amp; Wrap Up Idea Synthesis)</p>\n\n<p>Leaving posts raw.

Here is what I do know:\n>There will be a web application that I write in some capacity.\n\n>There is a system or one or two (habit loops, RSA) that can be combined, exploited, and stripped into a framework to be molded into said app.\n\n>This system of daily, Diarist based writing as a keystone habit is working for me.

The 4HWW & I Will Teach You To Be Rich crowd. Even those that would read the Power of Habit! Self-improvement, not self-help. \n\nThe habit loop of my diary writing:\n1. Trigger: A lull in work & a \"remember to do\" thought.\n2. Routine: Research & writing (simultaneously)\n3. Reward: Feeling of accomplishment, guiltless play.\n4. Craving: For Meaning.\n\n___\n\nWednesday 6/25 - Preliminary Research\nRefocusing & RSA Frameworks\n\nDiarist probably needs to be renamed, but for now, we refocus to an RSA app. I'd say that the next few steps are to identify common frameworks for this and it's outlying dependancies, deconstruct them and apply them.\n\nAt its core, Diarist will boil down (framework) and put into app form the leading \"systems\" on skill acquisition. When finished with the acquisition, the user will be able to have that acquisition (put into guide form by the app) associated with him and broadcast into the community for glory. He will be able to track how many people have used his methods, either the entire guide or specific parts, say, his 1 of his 3 Minimum Effective Doses. The community will be connected in this way, and will drive the app through the competitive, motivated and demanding nature of its users. The idea is no longer a long term project tracker, but a fast pace race against the clock, or yourself in this case.\n\nI am still into the idea of daily tracking, but no doubt any RSA system will prescribe such a daily check in. It largely depends on the framework that we come up with. Daily tracking could be any type of media or format of writing (bullets, paragraphs, ect..)\n\nAs for development, the MEAN stack will be too complicated. A conversation with my boss and friend lead me to the KISS acronym. Keep it simple stupid! Too many difficult learning curves at once will destroy my ambition to complete this project.\n\nMEAN is a stack, and I don't really need a stack of separate languages when I am trying to learn web app fundamentals and construct a basic web app. Upon a recommendation from a friend. I will now use Parse + Backbone.js (Backend), JQuery (Middleware) and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (Frontend). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ATktgoXu9s\n\nFor the initial app flow, I will keep in mind the absolute minimum amount of functionality needed to implement the very basic idea of the app.\n\nBack to the building metaphor if the building is the overall accomplishment, the app definitely needs to provide the scaffolding, the user provides the workers and I am undecided on whether we are to provide the food and praise sustain the workers (motivation by way of habit loops, \"internet points\"/incentivization, ect..).\n\nAs for different RSA systems I know of these so far:\nTim Ferriss - DSSS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzyvvkiUIKY\nJosh Kaufman - First 20 Hours\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB6K60mkmho\nhttp://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-acquire-any-new-skill-in-20-hours-or-less/\nMalcolm Gladwell - 10,000 Hours in \"Outliers\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k4kv2xW7JM\nRandom Hodge-podge of Blogs\nhttp://lifehacker.com/the-science-behind-how-we-learn-new-skills-908488422\n\n\n\n\nExpanding on marketing:\nDo more, work less. Essentially we need to remove everything about the acquisition process so that all there is left to do is the leg work. Like putting blinders on a horse, it does not tell the horse where to go, but narrows the path so that the chances of him getting there greatly increase. The end goal will not be to become expert, but to become adequate. So that they \"Know what they're doing.\"\n\n___\n\n6/26 Thursday - App Flow\nFerriss Framework: DiSSS & CaFE\n\nThese frameworks proposed by Ferriss, Kaufmen and to a certain extent Gladwell, all have nessecarily the same steps and are basically mental \"frameworks\". It would probably benefit me to read more about Munger's mental models, as they seem to be useful and similar in wading through these RSA systems. My job will be to give representation in an app for what happens explicitly in the framework and appropriately guide what happens implicitly for the user, making it all interactive so all that is left is the leg work.\n\nPage 38 in the 4HChef is the perfect framework. Ferriss sets up DiSSS as the explicit framework and CaFE (and earlier remarks about emotional blockage, fear, ect..) as the implicit mental happenings that specifically aid the legwork. \n\n1. User enters all of the \"minimum learnable units\"\n2. User selects the most important of the units\n3. User orders these important units\n4. User sets up stakes\n\nSay that 1,2,3 are the beginning, the leg work (CaFE) happens in the middle, and 4 is realized at the end. The user basically defines the beginning and end of the project first and then fills in the gaps.\n\nUsers also need to set up CaFE, especially frequency. This will allow the app to remind them and send them resources. \n\nI believe that the learnable units and stakes will play the largest role in the community aspect of this, which is really becoming increasingly important. The overall topic and learnable units are community links because they are suggested and searchable, maybe one gets awarded for using less or more unique units? The stakes motivate the competitive and urgency aspects of the user and community. The user is simple enough, when they finish a unit, they can record their progress and be rewarded with validation to the community, metrics about how pieces of their progression is being used by the community, achievements, points, ect... How stakes as they relate to a unit or a whole skill are going to integrate with the community, I don't know. We don't want users to be pitted against each other like: \"You and Bill will run the La Jolla Half Marathon in 2 months\", this is to blatant of an accountabilibuddy. At some level there needs to be approval or disapproval from the community about what the members of it are doing in their personal skill trees.\n\nInstead of blogging in between the units, the user is only prompted to share information or validate that he has completed that unit, when he has completed the unit. No mandatory intermediate posts.\n\nThere is a skeleton framework, listed above that will be the core of the app. But, RSA is as much dependent on the framework as well as the mindset, there is a highly demanding mental part of doing the least amount for the most gain. Whether this instruction is integrated with the core or proposed as a \"tutorial\", since we are already gamifying with the community and the stakes, i do not know.\n\nBy the way, skills or entire subjects need to be \"two nouns out\". This means that Learning Japanese is not good. Learning All of the Japanese Kanji is good. Playing guitar is not good. Playing Blues guitar is good. Remember that this is not a prolonged-research project, it is a semi-specific, fast paced, competitive, amateur (in the vein of Kaufmen), rapid skill acquisition. This is NOT a project guide or mastery of a skill. This app would be good, say in this situation for learning my \"Web App with Parse & Backbone.js\" section. Even build a web app would be fine, not create a top 100 app from scratch. Skill, not project based. Most of these rules need to be implicit in the design of the program, there should not be \"learn all this stuff\" to use my app to \"learn more stuff.\"\n\n####Groundwork & Deconstruction\n> To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. - Abraham Maslow\n\n>When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles - John T. Reed\n\nThis will the the process of breaking apart the skill into the minimum learnable units. Finding these is the difficult part, which will be either taught or integrated into the app. I vote for integration, but I lack ideas about how to do this currently. Anyway, there are specific mental models or \"deconstructors\" or tools by which to deconstruct that you can run the skill through and out will pop the parts. There are obviously many more, but I see 5 right now. It is necessary to stress that some of these may work for some skills and not for others. This section could greatly expand upon integration Munger's models and [Farnam Street's models](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/).\n\nBefore addressing the models, information needs to be provided on finding materials on the skill from which to deconstruct the units. The user needs to have information on the groundwork for their subject. Maybe we instruct the user to find some authoritative or classic resources on the skill? Suggestions should be pulled for them. Again, little tricks can be provided for example:\n- Read overview materials, look for top rated books on the skill on Google or Amazon.\n- Look at the author's bibliography or keep an eye out for any mention of leading or classic resources\n- Youtube\n- Look for leading content.\n\nReduction: The common parts between many things. This works well for numerous instances of memorization. Japanese characters, dance routines, blues songs. For example in every blues song there is usually certain common chords, certain common progressions and certain common licks. Learning 3 blues boxes or scales could yield infinite popular blues licks.\n\nInversion:\n\nTranslation:\n\nNegation: What a bad person does.\n\nInterview or \"Expert-Watching\": \n\nThese units are \"Action-centric\" (Principles) not \"Thing-centric\" (Specifics). For instance: DO: time yourself while tying knots, aim to get faster with each time. NOT: learn to tie a hookydoodle knot.\n\n\"Thing-centric\" units are valid, but should be reserved and separated from the minimum learnable units, as simply learning a square knot is extremely beneficial to the knot tying discipline, as is buying rope. How these will be integrated with the system, just as a list of resources and applications, has yet to be determined.\n\nPresumably these units have already been internalized or read in the pre-deconstruction stage of resource finding. \n\n\"Thing-centric\" units limit the user from personalizing the process and separate them from the process itself, which will probably lead to failure. However if there is some must read book on knot tying, it is probably important.\n\nWhat and why professional knot tiers are doing what they are doing is more concerning than the specifics of how they are doing it.\n\n\n####Selection\nIs what covers the most ground. If you were looking at a linear representation with the skill on a line with amateur and expert on either end, what did they do that allowed them to cover the most ground on the line? What are the biggest small wins?\n\n\n####More Proposed Resources relating to RSA:\n\n- The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance \n\n- The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning\n\n- Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger, 3rd Edition\n\n- [The Makings of An Expert - Anders Ericsson](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/ericsson2007a.pdf)\n\n- The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills\n\n- The Road To Excellence: The Acquisition of Expert Performance in the Arts and Sciences, Sports, and Games\n\n\nBy reading these books, we will identify what methods are similar and overlap in getting to  an amateur status and a master status. Figuring out what is the MED for amateurism, that mimics those methods that masters use? \n\n___\n\n5/27 Friday - Preliminary Research\n\n> Learning to program is like learning to write good natural language. The best way to do it is to read some stuff written by masters of the form, write some things yourself, read a lot more, write a little more, read a lot more, write some more ... and repeat until your writing begins to develop the kind of strength and economy you see in your models. - Eric Steven Raymond in [How to Become a Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)\n\nAn essay for programmers similar to Gladwell's 10,000 hours, http://norvig.com/21-days.html\n\nA great summary of the beginning of Kaufmen's book by Ramit Sethi, http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-acquire-any-new-skill-in-20-hours-or-less/\n\nFor web app flow, http://bitovi.com/blog/2014/06/web-app-theory.html\n\nMore on the skill declaring, my two nouns out thing is covered in Kaufman's \"Target Performance Level\". The TAL is set after the skill, this is often what is two or three nouns out more importantly \"what is achievable for the amateur you!\". The skill declaration is general: \"Doing yoga.\" TAL is digging deeply and realistically, \"I want to set up a personal, at-home yoga practice.\"\n\nThe units are subskills, achieving these subskills is motivated by frequency ie habit loops.\n\nImportant terms to define will be learnable units (whether they are subskills or what! CLEARLY), skill declaration and TAL.","html":"<h5 id=\"chapters\">Chapters:</h5>\n\n<p>Preliminary Research <br />\nApp Flow/Wireframing (Framework) <br />\nMilestone: Initial Marketing Site <br />\nMarket Validation <br />\nWeb App (Backend) Basics w/ Parse &amp; Backbone.js <br />\nDevelopment Phase 1</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Monday 6/23 - Preliminary Research <br />\nRSA + LAL</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know and with a quick Google search, there are no existing RSA apps.

At some level there needs to be approval or disapproval from the community about what the members of it are doing in their personal skill trees.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of blogging in between the units, the user is only prompted to share information or validate that he has completed that unit, when he has completed the unit. No mandatory intermediate posts.</p>\n\n<p>There is a skeleton framework, listed above that will be the core of the app. But, RSA is as much dependent on the framework as well as the mindset, there is a highly demanding mental part of doing the least amount for the most gain. Whether this instruction is integrated with the core or proposed as a \"tutorial\", since we are already gamifying with the community and the stakes, i do not know.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, skills or entire subjects need to be \"two nouns out\". This means that Learning Japanese is not good. Learning All of the Japanese Kanji is good. Playing guitar is not good. Playing Blues guitar is good. Remember that this is not a prolonged-research project, it is a semi-specific, fast paced, competitive, amateur (in the vein of Kaufmen), rapid skill acquisition. This is NOT a project guide or mastery of a skill. This app would be good, say in this situation for learning my \"Web App with Parse &amp; Backbone.js\" section. Even build a web app would be fine, not create a top 100 app from scratch. Skill, not project based. Most of these rules need to be implicit in the design of the program, there should not be \"learn all this stuff\" to use my app to \"learn more stuff.\"</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"groundworkdeconstruction\">Groundwork &amp; Deconstruction</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. - Abraham Maslow</p>\n  \n  <p>When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles - John T. Reed</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This will the the process of breaking apart the skill into the minimum learnable units. Finding these is the difficult part, which will be either taught or integrated into the app. I vote for integration, but I lack ideas about how to do this currently. Anyway, there are specific mental models or \"deconstructors\" or tools by which to deconstruct that you can run the skill through and out will pop the parts. There are obviously many more, but I see 5 right now. It is necessary to stress that some of these may work for some skills and not for others. This section could greatly expand upon integration Munger's models and <a href=\"http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/\">Farnam Street's models</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Before addressing the models, information needs to be provided on finding materials on the skill from which to deconstruct the units. The user needs to have information on the groundwork for their subject. Maybe we instruct the user to find some authoritative or classic resources on the skill? Suggestions should be pulled for them. Again, little tricks can be provided for example: <br />\n- Read overview materials, look for top rated books on the skill on Google or Amazon.\n- Look at the author's bibliography or keep an eye out for any mention of leading or classic resources\n- Youtube\n- Look for leading content.</p>\n\n<p>Reduction: The common parts between many things. This works well for numerous instances of memorization. Japanese characters, dance routines, blues songs. For example in every blues song there is usually certain common chords, certain common progressions and certain common licks. Learning 3 blues boxes or scales could yield infinite popular blues licks.</p>\n\n<p>Inversion:</p>\n\n<p>Translation:</p>\n\n<p>Negation: What a bad person does.</p>\n\n<p>Interview or \"Expert-Watching\": </p>\n\n<p>These units are \"Action-centric\" (Principles) not \"Thing-centric\" (Specifics). For instance: DO: time yourself while tying knots, aim to get faster with each time. NOT: learn to tie a hookydoodle knot.</p>\n\n<p>\"Thing-centric\" units are valid, but should be reserved and separated from the minimum learnable units, as simply learning a square knot is extremely beneficial to the knot tying discipline, as is buying rope. How these will be integrated with the system, just as a list of resources and applications, has yet to be determined.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably these units have already been internalized or read in the pre-deconstruction stage of resource finding. </p>\n\n<p>\"Thing-centric\" units limit the user from personalizing the process and separate them from the process itself, which will probably lead to failure. However if there is some must read book on knot tying, it is probably important.</p>\n\n<p>What and why professional knot tiers are doing what they are doing is more concerning than the specifics of how they are doing it.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"selection\">Selection</h4>\n\n<p>Is what covers the most ground.

UNDER GENERAL LEARNING:\n\n>Ranked for importance\n___\nTuesday - 7/1\n\nImportant question of the day is: What resources did Ferriss and Kaufman use? This could lead me towards more academic, research based systems, which is what I need!\n>Maybe I should take my own advice & look at their bibliographies...\n\nHere is another batch of resources to look into: will help with the app design. \"Instructional Design\" specifically, Design For How People Learn (Voices That Matter) by Dirksen.\n\n####Kaufman:\n“VanLehn, Kurt. “Cognitive Skill Acquisition.” Annual Review of Psychology 47, no. 1 (1996): 513–539.”\n\n“Newell, Allen, and Paul S. Rosenbloom. “Mechanisms of Skill Acquisition and the Law of Practice.” Cognitive Skills and Their Acquisition (1981): 1–55.”\n\n\"Feynman Technique\"\n\nSwitching gears to marketing:\nI think it is just about time that we gain market validation. To see if we need to go back to the drawing board. I propose simply making a product homepage \"update you when we are ready\", set a tentative alpha date, get there information (email), provide incentive to sign up, tell about features ect. 4HWW would be good for this, also http://blog.gumroad.com/post/75142076006/anatomy-of-an-effective-product-page. There are really two levels to this: marketing and design.\n\nHybrid app/RSA course?\n\n### Curve\n####Curve is a skill aquisition framework built to help normal people do extrodinary things. \n\nOur hope is that by harnessing the latest research by academics, authors, and bloggers alike, we will be able to build a strong community that will push the boundaries of learning. The framework is only half the battle, we need you.\n\nHelp us consider the \"learning curve\" a thing of the past. \n\nMade sales test site wireframe\n\n\n___\nWednesday - 7/2\nDomains & Measuring Demand\n\ncurvatu.re would be a pretty cool domain name. Or just some version of curveapp. \n\nThe \"Start Small, Stay Small\" book & 4HWW both have similar and great ideas for measuring demand. My main strategy will be to build a small marketing site and see how many people I can get to \"opt-in\". I should clearly identify where \"lifehacker\" types hang out & blogs that they might read. Off the top of my head I would go for Tim Ferriss' blog, Zen Habits, Lifehacker, reddit, hackernews ect. Then I need to direct traffic to my site through ads, but more likely guest articles and championing by others to \"measure demand\". Previously, I can use adwords & other keyword tools. Definitly needs to have conversion trackers on the site.\n\n####Current Research Reading:\nThe Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning\n\nThe Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance \n\nBuilding Expertise - Cognitive Methods for Training and Performance Improvement by Ruth Clark (ebrary)\n\nThe Creative Habit by Twyla Tharp\n\n\nMay use Meteor.js instead of Parse. Looks newer and transparently uses the MEAN stack, instead of the \"behind closed doors\" feel or Parse or Firebase. Eww firebase...\n\nMeteor takes care of Express & Angular, thank god, leaving only their special implimentation of Mongo (MiniMongo) & Node.js. I need to learn about document (JSON) databases (NoSQL) before I begin. High hopes though.\n\nNeed to find effective web app mockups for the marketing mini site. The list of crowdfunding sites that this guy has are golden for finding short app marketing pitches & mockups. http://www.apptamin.com/blog/get-funding-mobile-app/\n\nAlso this:\nhttp://www.apptamin.com/blog/create-your-apps-website-before-your-first-line-of-code/\n\n...speaks for itself.\n___\nThursday - 7/3\nApp Flow\n\nJust transferring paper notes now...\nSome slogans:\n\"Learn more, do less\"\n\"A framwork for rapid skill aquisition\"\n\"An api for life\"\n\nI was pretty fond of the last one, so It kind of spurred an idea. What if we split Curve into two parts a la an api and a program made with it. Obviously we cannot make it \"cheesily\" code based: deconstructSkill(); but I believe it would be intelligent to nod our head to successful APIs and the ways that they are put together. \n\nIn my head, the framework is comprise of two things the interactive skill interface and the educative element (the docs). The two will play heavily off of eachother, especially from interface -> docs. I decided that we will let users take care of any subject specific material, we will really only provide resources on the \"meta\" of it all. In this way, users must be able to use MED's or Subskills that belong to other users. Another cool thing would be for any changes or material by users to be commited to the docs immediately (async w/ Meteor!). So that the docs contain both the \"meta-learning\" info and material/best practices organized by subject. Anything inputted by the user will be \"highly modualar\" and availible for use by the community.\n\nAs far as what goes into the docs, I imagine in the vein of APIs we have sections and forms of usage (predetermined \"methods\" - models, heuristics, best practices and/or just general info). For example under the \"Deconstruction\" section we could have various models and their usages to create MEDs, and under \"Target Application Level\" we just have a definition and examples. Examples will be key for all.\n\nSome thoughts on Skill defining for the user, we should have a Subject, Skill, Target approach. That is: what general catagory the skill falls under, what the skill is (two nouns out), what the user's target application is. Ex: Programming, \"I want to learn server-side code\", \"I want to make a multi-user prototype of the Curve web app with Meteor.js (MEAN)\".\n\nSome thoughts on the opt in. We will have Closed Alpha and Open Beta for the stages of user \"population\"/bug fixes and subject specific content creation. Users that opt in within the mini site period will be invited to closed alpha, a basic features and information prototype. It is very important that they are introduced as the \"first\" that matter very much, we need to build a strong community or power users. Open Beta will be an open beta, with all of the three goals in mind, but with user leniency (they are scouting for bugs and creating content) and new alpha-distinct features. \n\nThis is important: http://zenhabits.net/top-20-motivation-hacks-19/\n\nZen Habits is another phenominal source along with the Minimalists for blog style RSA.

It will encompass factual knowledge about meta-learning, but its focus will be heuristic knowledge or flipping heuristics into facts (like Munger with his models). This knowledge is, \"experiental, more judgemental [intuition-al] knowledge of performance. Rarely discussed and largely individualistic.\" This is the cornerstone of Curve, to illicit heuristic knowledge from users about skills and help others to apply this knowledge. \"It is knowledge of good practice, good judgement, and plausible reasoning within the domain. It is the knowledge that underlies the art of good guessing.\"\n\n>\"Experience is a prerequisite to human expertise... expertise gained through experience can be codified in the knowledge base as rules, heuristics, definitions, taxonomies, prototypes, statstics of prior associations [and] previously solved cases.\"\n\nWhen I am ready to actually design the knowledge base, I need to come back to Part 3 (127) and basically read the book from there. \n\n####So far we have:\n#####Skill Declaration \n(Subject, Skill, Target)\n >\"A problem well stated is a problem half solved\"\n \n Docs: Lovability of skill choice\n\n#####Deconstruction \n(Distilling expertise - Finding other's \"best practices\", Defining subskills (What are the essential in between steps, subjects, ect, NOUN CENTRIC) these are a distillation of the actions (VERB CENTRIC - best practices) of the experts)\n\n#####Selection\n(Deals with thinning out deconstructive research, Grouping and 80/20ing subskills, Formation of *your* \"best practices\" on for each subskill (MEDs). (Actionable steps to achieve subskills, VERB CENTRIC))\n> What is common among best performers, infrequently taught and accords with personal strenghts.\n\n#####Sequencing \n(Deals with ordering \"best practices\", frequency, habits, feedback loops, practice periods, selecting tools)\n \nDocs: willpower as a muscle, ZenHabits\n\n#####Stakes\n(Deals with commitment and end product)\n \n####As for major resources we have at our disposal: Kaufman, Ferriss, Duhigg, Ericsson.\n\n\nA note on the \"rapidity\" of this system, it is not defined by hours or time. The only goal we have is to meet the sweet spot between time and aquisition based on your target. The curve is different for all people and all subjects. We do not encourage you to set the bar low or shoot for the stars, rather set a realistic goal and go for it.\n\n####An example of MEDs, subskills, and targets\n\nSubject: Fitness\n\nSkill: Weight Management\n\nTarget: I want to get back down to my pre pregancy weight of 130lbs.\n\nSubskills: (What are the most essential things that people successful at weight loss do to achieve their long term (target/skill) goals?):\n\n- Dietary Change\n- Cardio Exercise\n- Slow Cadence Weight Training\n\nMEDs: (What are the most effective, *repeatable* if possible, ways that people successful at weight loss achieve their short term (subskills) goals?):\n\n- Dietary Change: Consume 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. Ferriss uses protien shakes.\n- Cardio Exercise: Run a mile every two days.\n- Slow Cadence Weight Training: Five minutes of kettlebell swings twice a week.\n\n#####Work TODO: Mockups, Wireframes & *Marketing Mini Site*\n#####Home TODO: App Flow + Research\n___\nFriday - 7/4\nMore on Marketing\n\nAs far as marketing goes, I think that the two most important things are SEO and \"Hustle\".

[south of .5% is bad] - Walling\n\n> Freemium only works when you’re going after a huge market, which is why the most successful freemium companies like Dropbox and Evernote offer solutions targeted at large, horizontal markets. By pricing something of value at zero, you’ve anchored your paid product price to a low number, making it hard to charge a significant amount. You’ve also cannibalized potential customers by offering them a free alternative. Because a large percentage of users are free, it often takes millions of users to build a sizeable number of paying customers. Most freemium companies have customer conversion rates of between 1 percent and 10 percent (with the average around 2 percent to 4 percent). A typical customer also rarely pays more than a few hundred dollars per year. So if you want to build a $100 million annual revenue company, this implies that you likely need to reach many millions of users (see example below). If your market isn’t that big, you shouldn’t be building a freemium company.\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2012/11/04/should-your-startup-go-freemium/\n\n\nHere's another good source\nhttp://www.quora.com/Whats-the-average-freemium-conversion-rate-of-consumer-web-apps\n\n> Freemium is a marketing strategy, not a revenue model http://blog.priceintelligently.com/blog/bid/159885/Forget-Freemium-Why-It-s-Killing-Your-Pricing-Strategy\n\nhttp://www.totango.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-SaaS-Conversions-Benchmark2.pdf\n\n\nKeep in mind that conversion rates are conversion to free customers, those are usually around 1 to 5%. Above are some industry averages.\n\nAnalysis of the no credit card SaaS:\n10000 visitors - 1000%\n1000 signups - 10%\n150 paid (conversion) - 1.5%\n\nIn conclusion, I'll shoot a little below average because PPC advertising will convert less than content marketing or linkbacks. If I get below 8% signup, I need to pivot. If I get upwards of that, it's a go.\n\nIt is to be determined whether I will let the ad run for the month or for 200 clicks. 100 would give inaccurate data.\n\nOr, I go headstrong into development and marketing because I believe that my idea is one of a kind and PPC doesn't do it justice.\n\nHere are a few websites:\nfor listing startups: http://www.new-startups.com/\na cool masters at work video: http://devour.com/video/the-engraver/\nanother one:\nhttp://vimeo.com/98953952\n\n\n___\nTuesday, August 12th\n\nsubmit your startup: http://startuplister.com/\n\n___\nWednesday, August 13th\n\nWilly Site Review Implimentations\nStopped Adwords\n\nSo, I guess I'm just deciding to go with my gut in developing the app. Adwords gave me valuable experience with keywords and PPC (and how its not always the greatest option when you have slim competition). Slim competition is great, but I am counting on the fact that hopefully people exist that are self-learners. I'm not going to stake my life on this app or say it was a waste of time if no one uses it. Decidedly it will be my project coiciding with my \"Mind, Logic and Computation\" class.\n\nAs such, we should redefine the app yet again:\n\n**Surface**: Aquiring relevant, actionable \"skills\" *via* the app & docs.\n**Underlying**: Meta-learning, giving user the capacity for accurate self-study (& general learning) *via* self-report -> analysis by the app & direct reading -> app integration as far as the docs go.\n\nSo, the community aspect is very secondary, but also *needs* to be present. It's like playing a 200 player game of M&B online vs bots. It's the same game but you want to know you are not the only one living this expeirence.\n\nNext step would be to begin development & to define the \"Minimum Viable Product\". Putting this alpha build out in a full blast marketing effort will be the true test as to whether or not to continue.

[south of .5% is bad] - Walling</p>\n  \n  <p>Freemium only works when you’re going after a huge market, which is why the most successful freemium companies like Dropbox and Evernote offer solutions targeted at large, horizontal markets. By pricing something of value at zero, you’ve anchored your paid product price to a low number, making it hard to charge a significant amount. You’ve also cannibalized potential customers by offering them a free alternative. Because a large percentage of users are free, it often takes millions of users to build a sizeable number of paying customers. Most freemium companies have customer conversion rates of between 1 percent and 10 percent (with the average around 2 percent to 4 percent). A typical customer also rarely pays more than a few hundred dollars per year. So if you want to build a $100 million annual revenue company, this implies that you likely need to reach many millions of users (see example below). If your market isn’t that big, you shouldn’t be building a freemium company.\n  <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/04/should-your-startup-go-freemium/'>http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/04/should-your-startup-go-freemium/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here's another good source <br />\n<a href='http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-average-freemium-conversion-rate-of-consumer-web-apps'>http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-average-freemium-conversion-rate-of-consumer-web-apps</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Freemium is a marketing strategy, not a revenue model <a href='http://blog.priceintelligently.com/blog/bid/159885/Forget-Freemium-Why-It-s-Killing-Your-Pricing-Strategy'>http://blog.priceintelligently.com/blog/bid/159885/Forget-Freemium-Why-It-s-Killing-Your-Pricing-Strategy</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href='http://www.totango.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-SaaS-Conversions-Benchmark2.pdf'>http://www.totango.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-SaaS-Conversions-Benchmark2.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that conversion rates are conversion to free customers, those are usually around 1 to 5%. Above are some industry averages.</p>\n\n<p>Analysis of the no credit card SaaS: <br />\n10000 visitors - 1000% <br />\n1000 signups - 10% <br />\n150 paid (conversion) - 1.5%</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I'll shoot a little below average because PPC advertising will convert less than content marketing or linkbacks. If I get below 8% signup, I need to pivot. If I get upwards of that, it's a go.</p>\n\n<p>It is to be determined whether I will let the ad run for the month or for 200 clicks. 100 would give inaccurate data.</p>\n\n<p>Or, I go headstrong into development and marketing because I believe that my idea is one of a kind and PPC doesn't do it justice.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few websites: <br />\nfor listing startups: <a href='http://www.new-startups.com/'>http://www.new-startups.com/</a> <br />\na cool masters at work video: <a href='http://devour.com/video/the-engraver/'>http://devour.com/video/the-engraver/</a> <br />\nanother one: <br />\n<a href='http://vimeo.com/98953952'>http://vimeo.com/98953952</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Tuesday, August 12th</p>\n\n<p>submit your startup: <a href='http://startuplister.com/'>http://startuplister.com/</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Wednesday, August 13th</p>\n\n<p>Willy Site Review Implimentations <br />\nStopped Adwords</p>\n\n<p>So, I guess I'm just deciding to go with my gut in developing the app. Adwords gave me valuable experience with keywords and PPC (and how its not always the greatest option when you have slim competition). Slim competition is great, but I am counting on the fact that hopefully people exist that are self-learners. I'm not going to stake my life on this app or say it was a waste of time if no one uses it. Decidedly it will be my project coiciding with my \"Mind, Logic and Computation\" class.</p>\n\n<p>As such, we should redefine the app yet again:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Surface</strong>: Aquiring relevant, actionable \"skills\" <em>via</em> the app &amp; docs.\n<strong>Underlying</strong>: Meta-learning, giving user the capacity for accurate self-study (&amp; general learning) <em>via</em> self-report -> analysis by the app &amp; direct reading -> app integration as far as the docs go.</p>\n\n<p>So, the community aspect is very secondary, but also <em>needs</em> to be present. It's like playing a 200 player game of M&amp;B online vs bots. It's the same game but you want to know you are not the only one living this expeirence.</p>\n\n<p>Next step would be to begin development &amp; to define the \"Minimum Viable Product\". Putting this alpha build out in a full blast marketing effort will be the true test as to whether or not to continue. I guess Beta should be the goal for the class and this MVC - docs should be the goal 1 or 2 weeks into the class.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Thursday, August 14th</p>\n\n<p>I cant get over the feeling that Meteor.js is a little too hand-holdy.

What follows are sections from various essays written about the uses of & research behind this infant stage of the application.\n\n####Excerpts from Research\n######From \"Introduction\"\nSelf-learning is a subject that extends into many different disciplines. The most accessible way to enter the arena of altering mental processes is through the promise of “rapid skill acquisition.” Semi-scientific, non-academic writers such as Josh Kaufman and Tim Ferriss are accomplished investigators into this topic, championing simple, multi-step methods to “learn anything”. Bordering on self-help, these authors present steps that inject confidence and heightened sensitivity to information into a reader’s learning process. In the 4 Hour Chef , Ferriss dramatically unveils his rigorously (actually) tested methods for acquiring skills which seem to elude most learners. These authors do much to demystify seemingly intuitive skills, such as cooking, language learning, and musicianship. Although their empirically verified methods actually do promote self-learning, the authors fail to discuss any deeper grounding in a parent discipline, and thus, the steps seem to lack continuity. \n\nDespite this underlying “feeling”, there are many direct parallels in to Kaufman and Ferriss in the scientific study of metacognition. For example, Kaufman says to “Define your target performance level” as an endpoint for one’s skill acquisition, which is an important piece of data in measuring metacognitive judgements; whether one actually is doing as well as they say. However, in Kaufman’s system there is no mechanism by which to measure actual performance, so there is a very likely risk of repeating an erroneous process. A crucial point about self-learning is be able execute any mental process correctly, and rapid learning systems are unable to enforce this self-correction. There is little doubt whether a person can carry out the steps put forth by Kaufman and Ferriss, however, there is no way besides a total failure of the skill at the end of the process (ie: last place at the golf competition, unable to communicate with Japanese people) to motivate a correction of learning. Even if one competed in successively more difficult golf tournaments, as a “measuring stick” of progress, there would be no criteria by which to alter the learning process if one finds that they have a less than satisfactory grip on the skill. Although the processes detailed by Ferriss and Kaufman are explicit, they are of little use to a person who lacks the knowledge to self-regulate.\n    \nThe Skillgenie app was born from this need, seeking to report individual metacognitive measurements to augment the lack of correction in rapid learning. Data is given by the user in the form of individual posts concerning learning goals/progress/landmarks on a timeline illustrating a skill being learned (Simple & actionable, Ex: “Playing Golf\"). Data in/about their posts is aggregated, computed and presented to the user in the form of friendly, readable metrics concerning the learning process. The hope is that the user can use this data to accelerate their learning, by improving upon the process itself and thus being able to interact with the content at a more enjoyable speed, with less failure...\n\n######From \"Towards Metacognitive Measurment\"\n\nThere are three perspectives from which metacognitive measurements have been researched: computational, neurobiological and psychological. Until the late 20th century, the psychological perspective has been responsible for maturing the discipline of metacognition from its roots in the philosophy of mind. Concerning the computational perspective, the analysis of mental structures and processes is becoming increasingly crucial for the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The computational “human in the loop” simulation method of assessing aptitude in a specific activity (think flight simulation), is heavily dependent on the analysis of judgements, confidence and memory. The reality of psychophysical reductionism is confirmed in the neurobiological perspective on metacognition, as “our understanding of psychological constructs… have been enriched by the knowledge of their neural underpinnings.” In “Studying Metacognitive Processes at the Single Neuron Level”, Middlebrows et al express a similar sentiment, “neuronal correlates such of functions such as attention, executive control, working memory, decision-making and reward processing, all have been elucidated, to an impressive level of detail, at the single cell and circuit levels.” All of these perspectives serve to play an important role in the development of the Skillgenie metrics, however, we must begin by making clear what we are measuring before we discuss any nuances of implementation.\n\nThe key element that makes learners less error prone is a higher level of metacognitive efficiency. Although I will explain this more in depth, a working definition for efficiency is the measure of “objective memory ability” in a person. There are a series of measurements that comprise efficiency, namely: cognitive monitoring, metacognitive sensitivity & bias via “feeling of knowing” (FOK) judgements and metacognitive sensitivity & bias via “judgements of learning” (JOL). We are able to reach the efficiency measure by first assessing one’s executive control of memory, then calculating the disparity between one’s judgements about their knowledge vs. the reality of the situation.\n\nStraddling the line between psychological and neurobiological, we have memory, which Pina Tarricone in “The Taxonomy of Metacognition” says is the foundational, primarily measurable construct of metacognition. A study of metacognition in neuroscience concerns the “monitoring and control of information processing”. Arthur Shimamura in “Toward a Cognitive Neuroscience of Metacognition” gives parallel concepts for executive processes studied in neuroscience, one of which is cognitive monitoring. Monitoring (whose parallel process is called ‘updating’) “refers to the ability to modulate and rearrange activity in working memory.” This measure of executive control is crucial to mitigating errors in comprehension. Consider the following situation: a Skillgenie user watches a video by Tiger Woods on golf, saying that a good swing is dependent upon pivoting the foot exactly 45 degrees, and then overwrites the good information with false information given by his caddy, on the course. Because their working memory is deficient, they will continue to commit this same error...\n\n####Current Stage: Timeline & Metric Views \n\nIn order to implement a self-learning system that facilitates and promotes self-correction, it was necessary to harness the above metacognitive measurements. I chose to develop a “full-stack” Javascript web app named Skillgenie that, in essence, creates a feedback loop for learning in one system. If we take the traditional academic system, in which a student is presented with information, applies the information, then receives feedback on their application; the entire process spans a large amount of time. Skillgenie is designed to record one’s applications of their self-learning, so presentation of the information is a non-issue. However, Skillgenie (in its current state) becomes useful for tracking the progression of applications, from landmark “Goals” and steps to achieve those goals (“Practices”). The last two steps of the traditional educative feedback loop, application and feedback are dynamic in Skillgenie. To receive feedback on general aspects of learning, it becomes as easy as flipping over to the “Metrics” view. For example, Skillgenie is able to calculate cognitive confidence via the user’s practice and goal “difficulty” data to present accessible visualizations and actionable suggestions such as “decreasing (or increasing) the difficulty of goals” Skillgenie is designed to present the connections between applications of learning and especially between projected tasks and actual tasks. In both Ferriss and Kaufman’s accounts of learning a skill, deconstruction is necessary. The “timeline” view of Skillgenie functions like a todo list, where the user can project goals into the future and then track each step to achieving the goal. \n    \nFor measurement purposes, Skillgenie cements and hides some of the initial data entered about practices and goals, to present the user with data about their own notions of progress versus what is actually taking place. Each practice and goal shares a relationship to one another, either by parent goal or ramping difficulty (deviation of difficulty), so that the user can gain a holistic view of their learning process. In traditional methods of metacognitive measurement, the subject is usually presented with a questionnaire. Especially when asked about their “feeling of knowing”, students are blatantly asked, “how do you think you did on the test?” To avoid this removal from the immersion of self-reflection, Skillgenie tracks and computes confidence based on data given by the user. In other words, it is not blatantly obvious that measurement is taking place.The goal of many measuring efforts in metacognition focus on accuracy apart from the specific level of performance or, “objective memory ability”. These efforts, however fail to give the subject  any concrete or actionable data about themselves. In addition, measurements like meta-d`, while extremely useful, have little to do with any specific context and have no correlate information for the layperson. Skillgenie attempts to make these scientific metrics available and accessible for all learners. \n\n####The Road Ahead\n\nThank you for bearing with me through the \"wall of text\". I am not sure whether writing about Skillgenie makes me more or less confused about the concept, but it certainly informs my progress. I plan to smooth out the stark front end and deepen the metrics with a study of Machine Learning over the next 4 months (completed). Eventually, I would like to make this a usable application, open to the public, but for now, an account system and community linkage are low on my list. Thus, this project has become more of a proof of concept, more about the quality and depth of the application than an effort to push it out the door. \n\n+ For technology questions, please refer to my research oriented [repository](https://github.com/jacksonsouza/399-mlc).\n\n+ For the source code itself, please go [here](https://github.com/jacksonsouza/skillgenie).","html":"<p>Latest Build: <a href='https://damp-depths-5898.herokuapp.com/'>https://damp-depths-5898.herokuapp.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>If we take the traditional academic system of learning, in which a student is presented with information, applies the information, then receives feedback on their application; the entire process spans a large amount of time.

Thus, this project has become more of a proof of concept, more about the quality and depth of the application than an effort to push it out the door. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For technology questions, please refer to my research oriented <a href=\"https://github.com/jacksonsouza/399-mlc\">repository</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>For the source code itself, please go <a href=\"https://github.com/jacksonsouza/skillgenie\">here</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1420955309004,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1433825675426,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1420963125786,"published_by":1},{"id":29,"uuid":"f24222e5-4cff-4bb4-97c1-f78b282867c0","title":"Skillgenie 10","slug":"skillgenie-11","markdown":"For Weeks 2 & 3 of semester,\nconcerning catagories: **Linear *Regression* &  Optimization**,\nspecifically the algorithm: **Batch Gradient Descent.**\n\n*Simple, easy to use & widely applicable*\n\n___\n**Order of Learning**:\n\n+ Watched Ng Lecture, read \"Optimization\" section in \"Programming Collective Intelligence\", reviewed Ng notes.\n+ Watched few clarification videos & read relevant introductory blog posts, chapters\n+ Dissected parts of algorithms & learned associated ML concepts.

Along the way you’ll install a few Add-ons as well.\n\nNote: All of the following commands should be executed from the root of the project directory.\n\n$ heroku login\nAfter logging in, you may be prompted to add SSH keys. Follow the directions as you go.\n\nNext create a file named ‘Procfile’ and put the following single line of code in it:\n\n1\nweb: node server.js\nCreate an app under your Heroku account:\n\n$ heroku create\n\n`Next we need to install the first add-on for the app, MongoHQ. MongoHQ is another cloud based hosting service specifically for MongoDB that works extremely well with Heroku. Like Heroku, MongoHQ has a sandbox level service that is absolutely free!`\n\n$ heroku addons:add mongohq\nNote: In order to actually use add-ons, you will need to be sure your account has complete billing information. This is only because most services are scalable and have limited terms. Should you exceed those terms then billing would kick in.\n\n```\nNext go to the Heroku website and access your dashboard/Apps. Click on the app that was just created, and then click on the MongoHQ Add-on. Go into the Collections and add a collection for your app (i.e. “contacts”). Then go into Admin and select the Users tab. Create a new user to access the database (give it any username/password you want). Switch back to the Overview tab and copy the Mongo URI.\n\nEdit server.js and the line that connects to the mongodb server will need to be changed to the Mongo URI that was just copied. Change the <user> and <password> to the MongoHQ user that you just created.\n```\n\nNow we can push our code up to Heroku:\n\nNote: Before you push your code to Heroku, because it uses Git to do so, you want to make sure that any changes you’ve made up to this point have been staged and committed (i.e. that change you just made to server.js for your MongoHQ connection URI). The easiest way to do that is with the following commands:\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"Updates for Heroku\"\n$ git push heroku master\nNow that the app is setup, add-ons installed, and code pushed up we need Heroku to actually launch our server. To do this Heroku uses something called a dyno which will read the Procfile and execute its command:\n\n$ heroku ps:scale web=1\nFinally, launch your new Heorku app in a browser:\n\n$ heroku open\n\n###Notes on RequireJS\nBasically, we need it, it is part of the stack, and it is a best practice.\n\nHere is a post on Almond.js and why we are using it on top of Require: http://www.justinmccandless.com/blog/Building+a+Requirejs+Project+to+a+Single,+Reusable+File\n\nAlways use Ctrl + C when terminating an instance of Grunt.\n\n###Notes on Web App Directory Structure.\n\nFrom http://www.terlici.com/2014/08/25/best-practices-express-structure.html:\n```\nproject/\n  controllers/\n    comments.js\n    index.js\n    users.js\n  helpers/\n    dates.js\n  middlewares/\n    auth.js\n    users.js\n  models/\n    comment.js\n    user.js\n  public/\n    libs/\n    css/\n    img/\n  views/\n    comments/\n      comment.jade\n    users/\n    index.jade\n  tests/\n    controllers/\n    models/\n      comment.js\n    middlewares/\n    integration/\n    ui/\n  .gitignore\n  app.js\n  package.json\n```\n\nLineman.js:\n```\n.\n├── app\n│   ├── js                  #

Along the way you’ll install a few Add-ons as well.</p>\n\n<p>Note: All of the following commands should be executed from the root of the project directory.</p>\n\n<p>$ heroku login\nAfter logging in, you may be prompted to add SSH keys. Follow the directions as you go.</p>\n\n<p>Next create a file named ‘Procfile’ and put the following single line of code in it:</p>\n\n<p>1 <br />\nweb: node server.js <br />\nCreate an app under your Heroku account:</p>\n\n<p>$ heroku create</p>\n\n<p><code>Next we need to install the first add-on for the app, MongoHQ.

Like Heroku, MongoHQ has a sandbox level service that is absolutely free!</code></p>\n\n<p>$ heroku addons:add mongohq\nNote: In order to actually use add-ons, you will need to be sure your account has complete billing information. This is only because most services are scalable and have limited terms. Should you exceed those terms then billing would kick in.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Next go to the Heroku website and access your dashboard/Apps. Click on the app that was just created, and then click on the MongoHQ Add-on. Go into the Collections and add a collection for your app (i.e. “contacts”). Then go into Admin and select the Users tab. Create a new user to access the database (give it any username/password you want). Switch back to the Overview tab and copy the Mongo URI.\n\nEdit server.js and the line that connects to the mongodb server will need to be changed to the Mongo URI that was just copied. Change the &lt;user&gt; and &lt;password&gt; to the MongoHQ user that you just created.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we can push our code up to Heroku:</p>\n\n<p>Note: Before you push your code to Heroku, because it uses Git to do so, you want to make sure that any changes you’ve made up to this point have been staged and committed (i.e. that change you just made to server.js for your MongoHQ connection URI). The easiest way to do that is with the following commands: <br />\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -m \"Updates for Heroku\"\n$ git push heroku master\nNow that the app is setup, add-ons installed, and code pushed up we need Heroku to actually launch our server.

If n is divisible by any m then n is composite, otherwise it is prime.\n\n[List of 100 primes](http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/1000.txt)\n\n\n**2/10 - Array Pair Sum**:\n\nGiven an integer array, output all distinct and non-zero pairs that sum up to a specific value k.\n\n**2/11 - Email Duplicate Removal for ChefSteps**:\n\nIn your favorite language, write a working function that removes all duplicates from an unsorted list of email addresses while leaving the remaining list in the original order.  It should be able to handle say, 100,000 email addresses containing 50% randomly placed duplicates in well under 1 second on a typical modern laptop. How would your implementation be different if it needed to handle millions of records? Billions?\n\n**2/12 - Find Missing Element**\n\nThere is an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.\n\n**2/16 & 2/17 - Linked Lists**\n\n+ Research + understanding\n+ Class + method implimentation in JS\n+ Given a linked list of integers and an integer value, delete every node of the linkedlist containing that value.\n+ Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.\n+ Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.

Hash tables are built upon an array where the index of the desired pair is known by feeding the desired key into the hash function. They are both types of associative arrays, and JS uses object literals as associative arrays. \n\nReally, you wouldn't use a hash table over a plain object literal unless you needed the actual hashing functionality (for passwords or other sensitive info).\n\n**2/18 - isSubstring & Rotation**\n\nAssume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i e , “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”)\n\n**2/19 - Binary Trees**\n\n[BT vs. BST](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6380231/difference-between-binary-tree-and-binary-search-tree)\n\n[Trees - CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFptHjTT3l8)\n\nBinary Tree: At most, two children\n\n+ Class + methods implimentation in JS\n+ Given a sorted (increasing order) array, write an algorithm to create a binary tree with minimal height.\n\n**2/20 - Review**\n\nHow we solve problems:\n\n+ Identify the pattern.

Last in, first out. Still harnesses data via nodes, however only allows access from the top. Good for order, not for much else.\n\nArrayList: dynamically resizing array. JS arrays already have this functionality.

Numpy and matplotlib have been my chosen tools for this.</p>\n\n<p>The algorithms I have chosen leave much to be desired, but I feel that if I groom my dataset and not impose too much complexity  on the simple algorithms, I can achive my goals to move this into a demo stage.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the iterative process of adjusting the problem statement, data and algorithm: <br />\n<img src=\"/content/images/2015/Apr/Screen-Shot-2015-04-06-at-7-49-51-PM.png\" alt=\"\" />\nHere is the current progrssion of the data, given the random sampling the sucesses in regard to time spent and difficulty are not clustered.
